>In 1906, the precursor of the FDA was formed to combat products that were fundamentally dangerous. Anger about products like Berry’s Freckle Ointment, a cosmetic that was quite likely to make you sick, or LashLure, which caused more than a dozen forms of blindness, moved the government to act. As much as fifty years later, product quality was still a crapshoot. Who knew when your car was going to break down? Today we take it all for granted. FedEx actually does deliver more than 99 percent of its packages on time. Cars don’t spontaneously break. Makeup doesn’t often cause blindness. Your web browser rarely crashes, the electricity almost never goes out, and air travel has never been safer. And yet we still talk about being very good at our craft as if it’s some sort of bizarre exception. Plenty of people are good at what you do. Very good at it. Perhaps as good at it as you are. Full credit for the work you’ve done and the skill you possess. But it’s not enough. Quality, the quality of meeting specifications, is required but no longer sufficient. If you can’t deliver quality yet, this book isn’t much help to you. If you can, great, congratulations. Now, let’s set that aside for a minute and remember that nearly everyone else can too.

## 📌 Summary
Quality used to be rare. Dangerous, unreliable products were common—until regulation and progress made consistent quality the baseline. Today, delivering *quality* is no longer a differentiator—it's a **requirement**. Everyone is expected to meet the standard, so just being good at what you do isn’t enough to stand out.

---
## 💡 Key Insights
- Quality is **expected**, not **celebrated**. It’s table stakes.
- In a world where **most products work well**, *being reliable* is not a marketing edge.
- If you're already delivering quality, great. But now your focus must shift to **meaning, connection, and change**.
- The real competition is in **emotional resonance**, not in functional perfection.
---
## 🧩 Applications to Any Business
- Don’t rely on saying “we’re the best” or “we do it right.” So does everyone else.
- Ask: What emotional or cultural **story** does your product tell?
- Your edge comes from who it’s *for*, how it *feels*, and what *change* it helps create—not just that it works well.

## 🎨 Applications to Your Poster / Design Brand
- **Printing quality, colors, delivery speed**—these should already be excellent. They’re *not* your USP (unique selling proposition).
- Instead, focus on:
  - What **emotional story** does each poster tell?
  - How does it make a person feel when they hang it up?
  - What *inner truth* or *hidden desire* does it reflect for them?
- Talk less about “quality posters” and more about **“posters that feel like they get you.”**

## 📋 To-Do List for Instagram Poster Growth
- [ ] Remove “high quality posters” as a tagline or marketing hook—it’s assumed.
- [ ] Replace it with something like: “Posters that punch you in the gut (emotionally).”
- [ ] Create a few **before/after posts**:
  - *Before*: a blank wall, uninspired mood.
  - *After*: your poster, and a feeling (ex: rebellion, nostalgia, motivation).
- [ ] Run a story poll: “What makes a poster unforgettable? (Emotion / Colors / Message / Something else?)”
- [ ] Feature testimonials or DMs where customers describe how your work *made them feel*—not just what they got.

## 🧠 Reminder
> “Full credit for the skill you possess. But it’s not enough.”
> Don’t compete on specs. Compete on *meaning*.
