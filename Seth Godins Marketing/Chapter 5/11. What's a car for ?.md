# 🚗 What's a Car For? - Notes

## 📔 Book
>What’s a car for? More specifically, what’s a teenager’s first car for? It’s not simply a need for transport. After all, when the teenager was fifteen, he didn’t have that much of a transport problem. And plenty of teenagers make it through the college years without a car. This is a want, not a need. Few purchases cause more change than this one, and in this case, we’re seeing different changes for different people. For the teenager, a car enables a change from dependent child to independent adult. That’s a shift in status, in perception, and in power. It’s far bigger than four wheels. For the parent, it causes a change from dominion over someone to offering freedom and responsibility. And it leads to significant discussions about safety, about control, and about status. What will the neighbors say? What will we tell ourselves about safety? About independence, opportunity, and coddling? All of these changes are at the heart of the car decision. When the designer, the marketer, and the salesperson see these changes at work, they provide more value, because they can design with these issues in mind
