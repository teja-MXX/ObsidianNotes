# 🕊️ Your freedom - Notes

> _Your freedom_

> You have the freedom to change your story. You can live a different one, one that’s built around those you seek to serve. You have the freedom to change how you spend your day. You can outsource the tasks and find the guts to do emotional labor instead. You can go out on a limb and do what others aren’t doing. The most frustrated marketers I know are the ones who take it as a given that because they are in industry x, they have no freedom. And so real estate brokers hustle for listings and do precisely what the other brokers do. And so pharma marketers run slightly generic ads and skirt the line in influencing doctors, instead of realizing how many options they actually have. And so we get on the Facebook merry-go-round, boosting our posts, counting our followers, and creating ever more content in the hope of being noticed. There are so many other ways to make an impact and earn trust. Much of what we take for granted in our marketing toolbox was considered a risky innovation just a few generations ago. It’s worth discarding the cruft that we built and replacing it with more generous tools
