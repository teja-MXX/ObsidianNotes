>_Where does love lie?_

>Pioneering technology journalist Clay Shirky understood how community-driven software changes everything: “We have lived in this world where little things are done for love and big things for money. Now we have Wikipedia. Suddenly big things can be done for love.” But it doesn’t end with software. The goal of the smallest viable audience is to find people who will understand you and will fall in love with where you hope to take them. Loving you is a way of expressing themselves. Becoming part of your movement is an expression of who they are. That love leads to traction, to engagement, and to evangelism. That love becomes part of their identity, a chance to do something that feels right. To express themselves through their contributions, their actions, and the badge they wear. You can’t hope that everyone will feel this way, but you can do your work for the people who do.

## **🔥 Summary**  
This passage emphasizes that great things can be built through love, not just money. The focus should be on finding your _smallest viable audience_—people who don’t just consume your work but deeply connect with it, love it, and see it as a reflection of who they are. That emotional bond creates engagement, traction, and loyalty that no marketing budget can buy.
