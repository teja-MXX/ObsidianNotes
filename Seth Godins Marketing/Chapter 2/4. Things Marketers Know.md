# 🧠 Seth Godin Insight: _Things Marketers Know_
## 📔 Book
```book
1. Committed, creative people can change the world (in fact, they’re the only ones who do). You can do it right now, and you can make more change than you can possibly imagine. 2. You cannot change everyone; therefore, asking, “Who’s it for?” can focus your actions and help you deal with the nonbelievers (in your head and in the outside world). 3. Change is best made with intent. “What’s it for?” is the posture of work that matters. 4. Human beings tell themselves stories. Those stories, as far as each of us is concerned, are completely and totally true, and it’s foolish to try to persuade them (or us) otherwise. 5. We can group people into stereotyped groups that often (but not always) tell themselves similar stories, groups that make similar decisions based on their perceived status and other needs. 6. What you say isn’t nearly as important as what others say about you.

## 📌 Summary

A short but powerful list of truths that shape effective, authentic marketing. These points center around **intent, storytelling, audience clarity, and influence**. Change happens not through appealing to the masses but by identifying, connecting, and leading a specific group who believe what you believe.

## ✨ Key Insights

- **Real change** comes from _committed, creative people_ who start now and stay consistent.
- Ask _“Who’s it for?”_ — you’re not for everyone, and that’s your superpower.
- Ask _“What’s it for?”_ — define your purpose with clarity.
- People believe their own stories — don’t sell by arguing, sell by aligning.
- Stereotypes, while imperfect, help us identify common narratives and behaviors.
- What _others say about you_ carries more weight than your own words — social proof matters.

## ✅ Checklist: Apply This to Your Poster Business

- [ ] Before designing a poster, ask: _Who is this for?_ — don’t generalize, be specific.
- [ ] Define clearly _what change you seek_ — awareness, inspiration, identity, etc.
- [ ] Focus on telling a story your target group already believes in.
- [ ] Avoid arguing with viewers — connect through _empathy and shared values_.
- [ ] Use familiar symbols or stereotypes _strategically_ to amplify emotional connection.
- [ ] Let your happy buyers do the talking — showcase reviews, reactions, and testimonials.
- [ ] Don’t get discouraged by the "nonbelievers" — they were never your audience.
