# File System Management

Managing file systems on Linux involves organizing, storing, and maintaining data on a disk or storage device.

## Supported File Systems

Linux supports various file systems, each suited for different scenarios:

- **ext2**: No journaling. Lightweight, good for USB drives.
- **ext3/ext4**:
  - **ext3**: Adds journaling support.
  - **ext4**: Default for most modern systems — supports large files, better performance and reliability.
- **Btrfs**: Advanced features like snapshotting and data integrity checks.
- **XFS**: High-performance with large file support; suitable for high I/O workloads.
- **NTFS**: Developed for Windows; useful for dual-boot or cross-platform drives.

> ⚠️ Choose a file system based on: **performance**, **data integrity**, **compatibility**, and **storage requirements**.

## Linux File System Architecture

- Hierarchical structure (root `/` as base)
- Uses **inodes** to store metadata (not data or file names).
- **Inode table**: like a library catalog storing metadata pointers to actual data blocks.

### 📚 Analogy
> Think of the Linux file system as a library.  
> **Inodes = index cards**  
> **Inode table = entire catalog**  
> **Files = books**

## File Types in Linux

### 📄 Regular Files
- Contain text (ASCII) or binary (image, audio, executables).
- Exist in directories under the root hierarchy.
### 📁 Directories
- Special files that contain other files/directories.
- Help organize data.
### 🔗 Symbolic Links (Symlinks)
- Act as shortcuts or references to other files/directories.
- Useful for organizing and quick access.

## File Permissions

Linux files have 3 permission categories:
- **Owner**
- **Group**
- **Others**

Each category can be granted:
- Read (`r`)
- Write (`w`)
- Execute (`x`)

Permissions are independent between categories.

## 📂 Listing Files with Inodes

```bash
tejaM20@htb[/htb]$ ls -il

total 0
10678872 -rw-r--r--  1 cry0l1t3  htb  234123 Feb 14 19:30 myscript.py
10678869 -rw-r--r--  1 cry0l1t3  htb   43230 Feb 14 11:52 notes.txt
```

## 🖴 Disk & Drive Management
Tools:
- `fdisk`
- `gpart`
- `GParted` (GUI)

### Using fdisk
```bash
tejaM20@htb[/htb]$ sudo fdisk -l
```

Output: 
```bash
Disk /dev/vda: 160 GiB, ...
/dev/vda1  *         2048 ... Linux
/dev/vda2       ...         Linux swap / Solaris
```

Partitions:
- `/dev/vda1`: Linux file system
- `/dev/vda2`: Swap space

## 📌 Mounting File Systems
Mount = link a storage device to a directory.

### 🔧 Manual Mounting
```bash
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb
cd /mnt/usb && ls -l
```

### 🔄 Automatic Mounting at Boot
However, if you want certain file systems or partitions to be automatically mounted when the system boots, you can define them in the `/etc/fstab` file. This file lists the file systems and their associated mount points, along with options like read/write permissions and file system types, ensuring that specific drives or partitions are available upon startup without needing manual intervention.

```bash
tejaM20@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/fstab

# /etc/fstab: static file system information.
#
# Use 'blkid' to print the universally unique identifier for a device; this may
# be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices that works even if
# disks are added and removed. See fstab(5).
#
# <file system>                      <mount point>  <type>  <options>  <dump>  <pass>
UUID=3d6a020d-...SNIP...-9e085e9c927a /              btrfs   subvol=@,defaults,noatime,nodiratime,nodatacow,space_cache,autodefrag 0 1
UUID=3d6a020d-...SNIP...-9e085e9c927a /home          btrfs   subvol=@home,defaults,noatime,nodiratime,nodatacow,space_cache,autodefrag 0 2
UUID=21f7eb94-...SNIP...-d4f58f94e141 swap           swap    defaults,noatime 0 0
```

## 📋 List Currently Mounted File Systems
```bash
mount

#Output
/dev/vda1 on / type btrfs (...)
sysfs on /sys type sysfs (...)
...
```

## 🔓 Unmounting File Systems
Use umount
```bash
sudo umount /mnt/usb
```

Unmounts the device from the system.
- Need sufficient permissions to unmount a file system
- Cannot unmount a file system that is in use by a running process

To ensure that there are no running processes that are using the file system, we can use the `lsof` command to list the open files on the file system.
```bash
cry0l1t3@htb:~$ lsof | grep cry0l1t3

vncserver 6006        cry0l1t3  mem       REG      0,24       402274 /usr/bin/perl (path dev=0,26)
vncserver 6006        cry0l1t3  mem       REG      0,24      1554101 /usr/lib/locale/aa_DJ.utf8/LC_COLLATE (path dev=0,26)
vncserver 6006        cry0l1t3  mem       REG      0,24       402326 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/perl-base/auto/POSIX/POSIX.so (path dev=0,26)
vncserver 6006        cry0l1t3  mem       REG      0,24       402059 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/perl/5.32.1/auto/Time/HiRes/HiRes.so (path dev=0,26)
vncserver 6006        cry0l1t3  mem       REG      0,24      1444250 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libnss_files-2.31.so (path dev=0,26)
vncserver 6006        cry0l1t3  mem       REG      0,24       402327 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/perl-base/auto/Socket/Socket.so (path dev=0,26)
vncserver 6006        cry0l1t3  mem       REG      0,24       402324 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/perl-base/auto/IO/IO.so (path dev=0,26)
...SNIP...
```

- To auto unmount a file system at shutdown, use the `/etc/fstab` file.
- `/etc/fstab` lists all mounted file systems and their options.
- Add `noauto` to the entry to stop it from auto-mounting at boot.
- This helps it unmount safely at shutdown.

**Example:**
```bash
/dev/sda1 / ext4 defaults 0 0
/dev/sda2 /home ext4 defaults 0 0
/dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb ext4 rw,noauto,user 0 0
192.168.1.100:/nfs /mnt/nfs nfs defaults 0 0
```

## 🧠 Swap

- Swap space is used when **RAM is full**.
- The kernel moves **inactive memory pages** to swap to free up RAM — this is called **swapping**.
- Helps in **smooth system performance**, especially with low RAM.

---

### 🔧 Creating Swap Space

- **During OS install** or **later manually** using:
  - `mkswap`: prepares a file/device as swap space.
  - `swapon`: activates the swap space.

```bash
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile
```

### 📏 Sizing & Managing Swap

- Swap size depends on **RAM size** and **usage type**.
    - Low RAM or heavy apps → more swap.
    - High RAM systems → less or even no swap (optional).

- Best practice:
    - Use **dedicated partition or file** to avoid fragmentation.
    - **Encrypt** swap space to protect sensitive data.

### 🌙 Swap for Hibernation

- Hibernation saves system state (apps + processes) into swap space.
- System powers off, and on boot, it **restores from swap**.
- Requires **sufficient swap space** (usually equal to or more than RAM).
