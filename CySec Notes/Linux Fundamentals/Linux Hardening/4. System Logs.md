# 🧾 System Logs

System logs on Linux are a set of files that contain information about the system and the activities taking place on it. These logs are essential for:

- Monitoring system behavior
- Troubleshooting issues
- Tracking application activity
- Detecting security events
    
---

## 🔐 Importance in Security

System logs are a **valuable source** for identifying potential security weaknesses and vulnerabilities. By analyzing logs, we can:

- Understand system behavior and network activity
- Detect unauthorized logins and attempted attacks
- Spot clear-text credentials
- Track unusual file access
- Identify signs of potential security breaches
    

---

## 🧪 For Penetration Testers

Penetration testers can **review logs after testing** to determine:
- If activities triggered **intrusion detection alerts** or **system warnings**
- The **effectiveness of security tests**
- Ways to **refine testing strategies**
- Areas where **security posture can be improved**
    

---

## ⚙️ Proper Log Configuration

To ensure log security and manageability:

- ✅ Set appropriate **log levels**
- 🔄 Configure **log rotation** to avoid oversized files
- 🔒 Ensure logs are **secure and access-controlled**
- 👁️ Regularly **review and analyze** logs to catch threats early

## 📁 Types of Linux System Logs

Here are common types of logs on Linux:

- **🧠 Kernel Logs** – Messages from the Linux kernel
- **💻 System Logs** – General operating system and service events
- **🔐 Authentication Logs** – Login attempts, sudo usage
- **📦 Application Logs** – Logs generated by specific applications
- **🛡️ Security Logs** – Events from security modules (e.g., SELinux, AppArmor)

### 🧬 Kernel Logs

- **Path**: `/var/log/kern.log`
- Contains messages from the **kernel** (hardware drivers, system calls).
- Useful for identifying:
    - Vulnerable or outdated drivers
    - Crashes, DoS-related errors
    - Suspicious system calls (potential malware)
- Monitor regularly for anomalies.

### ⚙️ System Logs

- **Path**: `/var/log/syslog`
- Tracks system-level events:
    - Service start/stop
    - Reboots
    - Login attempts
        
- Use this to:
    - Detect unauthorized access
    - Identify system issues (e.g., failed service startups)
    - Analyze service behavior

### 🔐 Authentication Logs

- **Path**: `/var/log/auth.log`
- Focuses on user authentication:
    - Successful & failed login attempts
    - sudo usage   
- Valuable for:
    - Detecting brute force attacks
    - Tracing privilege escalation attempts
    - Monitoring for suspicious authentication patterns
        
📝 **Example Insight**:

- User `admin` logs in using a public key.
- Admin belongs to `sudoers`.
- Unexpected traffic on port 22 noted.
- Sessions created for `admin` and `root`.


### 🧾 Application Logs

- Paths vary:
    - Apache: `/var/log/apache2/error.log`
    - MySQL: `/var/log/mysql/error.log`
        
- Useful for:
    - Web server & database monitoring
    - Identifying data handling issues
    - Detecting unauthorized requests
        
### 🛡️Access Logs
- Record logins, file access, and network connections. 
- An example entry in an access log file can look like the following:
```bash
2023-03-07T10:15:23+00:00 servername privileged.sh: htb-student accessed /root/hidden/api-keys.txt
```
I
- In this log entry, we can see that the user `htb-student` used the `privileged.sh` script to access the `api-keys.txt` file in the `/root/hidden/` directory. On Linux systems, most common services have default locations for access logs:

| **Service**   | **Description**                                                                                   |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Apache        | Access logs are stored in the `/var/log/apache2/access.log` file (or similar, depending on distro). |
| Nginx         | Access logs are stored in the `/var/log/nginx/access.log` file (or similar).                      |
| OpenSSH       | Access logs are stored in the `/var/log/auth.log` (Ubuntu) or `/var/log/secure` (CentOS/RHEL).   |
| MySQL         | Access logs are stored in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.log` file.                                   |
| PostgreSQL    | Access logs are stored in the `/var/log/postgresql/postgresql-<version>-main.log` file.          |
| Systemd       | Access logs are stored in the `/var/log/journal/` directory.                                     |

### 🛠️ **Audit Logs**
- Log critical system events (e.g., config changes, file modifications).

### 🛡️Security Logs
- Paths vary by tool:
    - **Fail2Ban**: `/var/log/fail2ban.log`
    - **UFW**: `/var/log/ufw.log`
    - Other logs: `/var/log/syslog`, `/var/log/auth.log`
        

📌 Use for:
- Identifying brute-force attempts
- Reviewing firewall activity
- Spotting configuration tampering
