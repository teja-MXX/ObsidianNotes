# People don’t want what you make

## 📘 Book 

> People don’t want what you make.  
> They want what it will do for them. They want the way it will make them feel.  
> And there aren’t that many feelings to choose from.  
> In essence, most marketers deliver the same feelings. We just do it in different ways, with different services, products, and stories. And we do it for different people in different moments.  
> If you can bring someone belonging, connection, peace of mind, status, or one of the other most desired emotions, you’ve done something worthwhile. The thing you sell is simply a road to achieve those emotions, and we let everyone down when we focus on the tactics, not the outcomes.  
> “Who’s it for?” and “What’s it for?” are the two questions that guide all of our decisions.

## 📝 Summary

Customers don’t care about your product’s technical details—they care about how it makes them feel. All products are tools for emotional fulfillment: status, peace of mind, belonging, etc. The two key marketing questions are:  
**“Who is it for?”** and **“What is it for?”**

## 💡 Key Insights

- People buy **emotions**, not things.
- Common emotional drivers: **status, peace of mind, belonging, connection**.
- Your poster isn't just wall art—it can make someone feel **cool, nostalgic, proud, rebellious, or seen**.
- Tactics (like discounts or printing techniques) matter less than emotional impact.
- Your marketing should revolve around **who it’s for** and **what feeling you’re delivering**.

## 🎨 Application to Poster Business

- Your posters should **evoke emotions**: humor, pride, nostalgia, rebellion, pop culture identity.
- Don’t just describe the poster. Describe how **it makes someone feel when they put it on their wall**.
- For each poster, write a one-line answer to:
  - **Who is this for?** (e.g., Breaking Bad fans who love dark humor)
  - **What is this for?** (e.g., making their room look badass and expressive)

## ✅ Seth Godin-Inspired Poster Business Checklist

- [ ] For each poster, define the **core emotion** it delivers (e.g., nostalgia, badassery, rebellion).
- [ ] Answer: **Who is it for?** (define the exact audience—fans, age group, vibe)
- [ ] Answer: **What is it for?** (what emotional outcome it gives—coolness, fun, identity)
- [ ] Rewrite poster product descriptions to highlight **emotional outcomes**, not just design or size.
- [ ] Create Instagram captions or stories that **tap into feelings**, not just announce products.
- [ ] Group posters on your website by **emotional themes** (e.g., "For Rebels", "For Fans", "Feel-Good Art").
- [ ] Collect customer feedback on how they **feel** about your posters—use it in future storytelling.
- [ ] Avoid marketing purely on technical features (GSM paper, frame size)—focus on transformation.
