# What Promise are you making
## 📔Book
>What promise are you making? When the marketer shows up with his or her message (in whatever medium), it always takes the form of a promise: “If you do X, you will get Y.” That promise is often hidden. It can accidentally be set aside or intentionally camouflaged, but all effective marketing makes a promise. The promise isn’t the same as a guarantee. It’s more like, “If this works for you, you’re going to discover . . .” And so we can invite people to our jazz club to have more than a pleasant evening. Or promise that if they listen to our tapes, they’ll begin a spiritual journey. Or that our special kind of cheese will transport them to Old Italy . . . We’re not talking about slogans here, but these slogans give you an insight into the kind of promise I’m talking about. “They laughed when I sat down at the piano . . . but when I began to play . . .” is a promise about status. “Roll Tide!” is a promise about dominance. “Choosy mothers choose Jif,” is a promise about status and respect. “I pledge allegiance . . .” is a promise about belonging. “The Earth needs a good lawyer” is a promise about affiliation and justice. Your promise is directly connected to the change you seek to make, and it’s addressed to the people you seek to change.

## 1.  🎯 Summary of the Original Excerpt

Marketing, at its core, is about making a promise: “If you do X, you’ll get Y.” This promise isn't always explicit, but it’s embedded in every effective message. It's not a guarantee — it's an invitation or expectation of transformation. Whether the promise is about status, belonging, justice, or joy, it should align with the change the marketer seeks to make and speak directly to the intended audience.
