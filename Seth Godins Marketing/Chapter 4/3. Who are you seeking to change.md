>As soon as you ask yourself about the change you seek to make, it becomes quite clear that you have no chance of changing everyone. Everyone is a lot of people. Everyone is too diverse, too enormous, and too indifferent for you to have a chance at changing. So, you need to change someone. Or perhaps a group of someones. Which ones? We don’t care if they all look the same, but it would be really helpful if you had some way to group them together. Do they share a belief? A geography? A demographic, or, more likely, a psychographic? Can you pick them out of a crowd? What makes them different from everyone else and similar to each other? Throughout this book, we’ll return to this essential question: “Who’s it for?” It has a subtle but magic power, the ability to shift the product you make, the story you tell, and where you tell it. Once you’re clear on “who it’s for,” then doors begin to open for you. Here’s a simple example. Both Dunkin’ Donuts and Starbucks sell coffee. But for the first two decades of its existence, Starbucks didn’t try to sell coffee to people who bought from Dunkin’, and vice versa. While there are external hints about the two groups (in Boston, you would find more taxi drivers and construction workers at a typical Dunkin’ Donuts than you would at a Starbucks) the real distinction wasn’t external but internal. Starbucks set out to serve someone with a very precise set of beliefs about coffee, time, money, community, opportunity, and luxury—and by obsessing over this group of someones, Starbucks built a brand for the ages.

## 1. 🎯 Summary of the Original Excerpt

You can't change everyone — so great marketing focuses on changing _someone_. That “someone” is a specific group defined not by surface-level demographics but by shared beliefs, values, or desires. When you're crystal clear about who your product or message is for, it influences everything — what you make, how you tell your story, and where you show up. Brands like Starbucks succeeded by being intentional about serving a focused group with shared psychographics, not trying to please everyone.

## 3. 🖼️ Applications to Poster Business / Graphic Designing

- **Don’t design for ‘everyone who likes art’** — design for _fans of rebellion_, _nostalgic 90s kids_, or _minimalist thinkers_.
- **Build collections or series around audience clusters** — like “Anime Addicts,” “Cult Movie Buffs,” “Desi Meme Lords,” or “Melancholy Poets.”
- **Understand your customer’s internal world** — what do they value? Escape? Identity? Humor?
- **Post your work where _they_ hang out** — niche forums, subreddits, or themed Insta pages, not just generic art spaces.
