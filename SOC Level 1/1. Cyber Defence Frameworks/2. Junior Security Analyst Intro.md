# 🛡️ Security Operations Center (SOC) Overview

## 🎯 Core Function of a SOC
The **Security Operations Center (SOC)** operates 24/7 to:
- 🧠 Investigate threats
- 👀 Monitor network and systems
- 🚫 Prevent attacks
- ⚡ Respond to security incidents

> 🗨️ Per McAfee:  
> "Security operations teams are charged with monitoring and protecting many assets, such as intellectual property, personnel data, business systems, and brand integrity."

# 🛡️ Story: A Night in the SOC

It was a quiet Tuesday night in the NovaApps Security Operations Center. Arjun, a Junior Security Analyst just four months into the role, sat in front of his glowing monitors. The room was still except for the hum of servers and the occasional clack of his keyboard.

His task was straightforward: monitor logs, review alerts, triage anything suspicious, and escalate anything serious to Tier 2. Most nights were uneventful. But not tonight.

An alert popped up on the SIEM dashboard. A successful login had occurred from Belarus—on a user account that normally logged in only from Bengaluru. The protocol used? RDP.

Arjun pulled the logs. There were six failed login attempts right before the success. Classic brute-force behavior. His networking basics kicked in. RDP uses port 3389. The timing looked off. The IP wasn’t in any known VPN pool.

Then, he spotted something more concerning. The account accessed the admin panel of an internal web app. This user didn’t usually need that.

He opened a ticket in the incident management tool. “Suspicious login from Belarus. Multiple failed attempts. Accessed admin panel. Possible compromise.”

As a Tier 1 analyst, his role was initial triage. He tagged the alert and escalated it to Tier 2 for deeper analysis. His job wasn't to solve it—but to raise the right flags, early.

Curious, he dove deeper. Checked the IP on Feedly. It had popped up in recent CTI posts linked to brute-force campaigns. He noted it in his IOC tracker.

Morning shift arrived. In the SOC sync, Rhea from Tier 2 shared updates. The attacker used a tool called BluePassCrack. The credentials were weak. The account was disabled in time.

Tier 3 joined in. They ran forensic memory dumps, analyzed the attacker’s behavior, and updated IDS rules to block future attempts. A new YARA rule was created just for this pattern.

Arjun leaned back, quietly satisfied. He hadn’t done everything—but he’d done his part. He’d spotted the smoke before it became fire.

Later, he updated his Obsidian notes. Revised the OSI model. Practiced Snort signatures. Made a to-do list: finish the Security+ module, study brute-force detection, and write a basic IDS rule.

It wasn’t flashy work. But it mattered. And in that moment, Arjun felt what it meant to truly begin as a Junior Security Analyst.
