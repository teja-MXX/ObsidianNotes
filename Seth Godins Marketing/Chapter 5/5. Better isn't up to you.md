>There are more than 250 models of motorcycles available for sale in Cleveland. Can you name them? No one can, not even a motorcycle collector. And the same thing is true for ketchup, for insurance brokers, for churches. So, how do we process this, remember this, choose a product? We remember the best one. Best for what? And that’s the key question. Best for us. If we care about sustainability and price, then our brain has a slot for our favorite brand, and it’s the one that’s the best at sustainability and price. No surprise. But our neighbor, the one who cares far more about status within the group and luxury, has a very different brand in mind. Which is not surprising, because we’re humans, not machines. Your job as a marketer is to find a spot on the map with edges that (some) people want to find. Not a selfish, unique selling proposition, done to maximize your market share, but a generous beacon, a signal flare sent up so that people who are looking for you can easily find you. We’re this, not that.

## 📝 Summary  
People don't remember or choose what's objectively best—they remember what's *best for them*. With too many choices in any category, people mentally sort by personal relevance. As marketers, our role isn’t to appeal to everyone but to clearly signal who we’re for and what we stand for.

## 💡 Key Insights  
- People don't choose the absolute best; they choose what fits their specific needs and values.  
- “Best” is subjective: it means something different to each person based on what they care about.  
- Your brand should act as a *beacon* for the right people, not a net trying to catch everyone.  
- Being clear about what you are *not* is as important as saying what you are.

## 🧠 Applications to Any Business  
- Focus on becoming “the best” for your niche audience, not for everyone.  
- Clarify your positioning: who are you for, and just as importantly, who are you *not* for?  
- Use branding and messaging to become easily recognizable by the right people.  
- Avoid vague, broad marketing that aims to please everyone—it pleases no one deeply.

## 🎨 Applications to My Posters/Graphic Design Business  
- Be clear in your branding: your pop art isn’t for everyone, and that’s a strength.  
- Define what your art stands for: is it nostalgia? Humor? Edginess? Culture commentary?  
- Choose a bold voice and aesthetic that appeals deeply to a *specific* kind of viewer.  
- Use your bio, captions, and visuals to make it easy for “your people” to recognize your work as theirs.
