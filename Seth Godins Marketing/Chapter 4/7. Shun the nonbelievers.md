>There‚Äôs a filter bubble. It‚Äôs easy to surround ourselves with nothing but news we agree with. We can spend our days believing that everyone shares our worldview, believes what we believe, and wants what we want. Until we start marketing to the masses. When we seek to serve the largest possible audience, that audience will turn us down. The chorus of ‚Äúno‚Äù will become deafening. And the feedback may be direct, personal, and specific. In the face of so much rejection, it‚Äôs easy to sand off the edges and fit in. Fit in all the way. Fit in more than anyone else. Resist. It‚Äôs not for them. It‚Äôs for the smallest viable audience, the folks you originally set out to serve.
