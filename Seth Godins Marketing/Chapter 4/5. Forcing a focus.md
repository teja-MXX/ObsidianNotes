> _Forcing a focus_
> 
> The relentless pursuit of mass will make you boring, because mass means average, it means the center of the curve, it requires you to offend no one and satisfy everyone. It will lead to compromises and generalizations. Begin instead with the smallest viable market. What’s the minimum number of people you would need to influence to make it worth the effort? If you could only change thirty people, or three thousand people, you’d want to be choosy about which people. If you were limited in scale, you’d focus your energy on the makeup of the market instead. When the Union Square Cafe opened in New York, its founder, Danny Meyer, knew that he could only serve six hundred people a day. That’s all the dining room could serve. If you can only delight six hundred people, the best way to begin is by choosing which six hundred people. Choose the people who want what you’re offering. Choose the people most open to hearing your message. Choose the people who will tell the right other people . . . The magic of Union Square Cafe wasn’t the real estate (it was in a lousy neighborhood when it opened) or in the famous chef (they didn’t have one). No, the magic was in the guts it took to carefully curate the customers. Choose the people you serve, choose your future. The smallest viable market is the focus that, ironically and delightfully, leads to your growth.

## 1. 🎯 Summary of the Original Excerpt

Chasing the _mass market_ dilutes your uniqueness. Trying to please everyone makes your work bland and forgettable. Instead, focus on the **smallest viable market**—the smallest group of people who would benefit and care about what you make. By choosing a precise audience, like Danny Meyer did with Union Square Cafe, you can serve deeply, meaningfully, and build a loyal base that spreads your message. Growth comes _not_ from appealing to everyone, but from choosing _exactly_ who to serve.

## 2. 💡 Key Insights

- **Mass = mediocre.** It forces compromise and leads to generic work.
- **The “smallest viable market” is where impact and momentum start.**
- **Curate your audience, don’t chase them.**
- **Delight a few deeply, and they will bring others.**
- **Choosing _who_ you serve is choosing your _future_.**
- **Growth is a byproduct of focus.**

## 3. 🖼️ Applications to Poster Business / Graphic Designing

- **Don’t design for everyone.** Design for your niche (e.g., anime fans, political rebels, nostalgic cinephiles, meme lovers).
- If you could only get **100 people to buy your posters**, who should they be?
- Focus on those who:
    - _Get_ your humor, references, and style.
    - Share your work online without being asked.
    - Would love to own a _collection_, not just one piece.
- Your **Instagram page** is like your “Union Square Cafe.” Don’t worry if it’s not a viral hit. Worry if it’s not speaking to _someone_ very clearly.
