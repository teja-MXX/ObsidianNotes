# ⏳ It's Time

## 📔 Book
```book
It’s time Time to get off the social media merry-go-round that goes faster and faster but never gets anywhere. Time to stop hustling and interrupting. Time to stop spamming and pretending you’re welcome. Time to stop making average stuff for average people while hoping you can charge more than a commodity price. Time to stop begging people to become your clients, and time to stop feeling bad about charging for your work. Time to stop looking for shortcuts, and time to start insisting on a long, viable path instead.
```
## 🧠 Summary  
This piece is a direct call to creators to abandon the exhausting, shallow hustle of modern marketing—clicks, likes, spammy promos, and begging for sales. It urges a shift away from fast, easy wins toward building something real, lasting, and valuable. It’s a rejection of mediocrity, shortcuts, and insecurity—and a reminder to take pride in your craft, your time, and your worth.

## 💡 Key Insights  
- 🛑 **End the Hustle Trap**: The fast-paced game of social media vanity is a loop that rarely leads to depth or success.
- 🚫 **Stop Chasing Attention**: Spamming, interrupting, and begging turn people away — not toward your work.
- 🎨 **No More Average**: Don't create generic work just to “sell” it. Make meaningful art for people who care.
- 💰 **Respect Your Worth**: Don't feel guilty for charging — your creativity is valuable and should be respected.
- 🧱 **Build a Long-Term Path**: Real success isn’t viral — it’s built slowly through consistency, integrity, and quality.

## ✅ Poster Business Application Checklist

- [ ] Don’t make posters for the algorithm — make them for *the people who actually vibe* with your art.
- [ ] Don’t lower your artistic bar to chase quick likes — raise your storytelling and visual impact.
- [ ] Price based on creativity, uniqueness, and quality — not on what others charge or what gets a quick sale.
- [ ] Post content with intention — reels, stories, and carousels that *build meaning*, not just hype.
- [ ] Remind yourself that art that lasts takes time. The long game is the *only* game.
