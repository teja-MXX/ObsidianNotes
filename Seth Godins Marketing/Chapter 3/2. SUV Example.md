# SUV Example (Seth Godin)

## ðŸ“” Book
```book
Most people reading this book donâ€™t market cars. But most of us have bought one. The question to ponder is: Why did you buy the one you bought? Why do people who will never drive off-road buy a ninety thousand-dollar Toyota Land Cruiser? Why pay extra for the Ludicrous Mode on a Tesla if you never expect (or need) it to go from 0 to 60 mph in less than 3 seconds? Why put a three thousand-dollar stereo in your car if you only listen to a thirty-dollar clock radio at home? Even more puzzling: the most popular color for cars varies by the kind of car being purchased. If weâ€™re unwilling to make utility the primary driver of our decisions when buying a fifty thousand-dollar vehicle, what chance does a bottle of perfume or a stick of gum have? Marketing isnâ€™t a race to add more features for less money. Marketing is our quest to make change on behalf of those we serve, and we do it by understanding the irrational forces that drive each of us.

## ðŸ§  Summary
- People don't buy products purely for **utility**.
- Examples:  
  - Buyers pay extra for off-road SUVs they'll never take off-road.
  - Buyers choose Ludicrous Mode on a Tesla even if they never use it.
  - Buyers install expensive stereos even though they listen to cheap radios at home.
- Car color preferences even change depending on the type of car, despite being the same "product."
- **Conclusion**: Utility isn't the real driver; emotion, status, identity, aspiration, and irrational desires drive most purchases.
- **Marketing** is not a race to add more features for less money â€” it's about **understanding and influencing these irrational forces**.

## ðŸ’¡Key Insights
- **Identity over Utility**: People buy what matches who they want to be, not what they strictly need.
- **Emotion > Logic**: Emotional needs dominate rational decision-making.
- **Marketing = Change Making**: Good marketing is creating emotional and identity-driven shifts, not just selling features.
- **Features are Commodities**: Emotional impact is what differentiates products, not raw specs.
- **Understand the Customer's Fantasy**: Customers buy dreams, status, belonging, not products.

## ðŸŽ¨ Applications to Poster Business
- **Posters = Identity Purchase**: Customers buy posters to express their personality, taste, and belonging â€” not just to decorate walls.
- **Sell the Feeling, Not the Features**: Instead of "High-quality print on 300 GSM paper," highlight "Bring your wall to life with bold energy."
- **Make Aspirations Visible**: Market your posters as a reflection of **who they aspire to be** â€” cool, edgy, nostalgic, artistic.
- **Price Isn't the Main Factor**: A great emotional connection can make a customer pay more, not less.
- **Create Emotional Categories**: Instead of only "Movie Posters," also have collections like "For the Rebels," "For the Dreamers," "For the Legends."
- **Focus Messaging on Identity**: Your posters are not wall decorations â€” they are **statements**.
