>_An aside about the reptile people who are secretly running things_

>Professor Roland Imhoff of the Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, Germany, wanted to understand what makes some people choose their beliefs. In particular, he’s been studying a particular kind of outlier: the conspiracy theorist. Since we know that conspiracy theories aren’t factual, why are they so appealing to some people? And which people? In one study he cited, it was found that many people who believe that Lady Diana is still alive, having faked her own death, also believe that she was murdered. And in a similar study, people who believe that Osama bin Laden was dead before the Navy Seals arrived at his compound are also likely to report that he’s still alive. The facts aren’t at issue here; they can’t be. What’s happening is that these theorists are taking comfort in their standing as outliers and they’re searching for a feeling, not a logical truth. Imhoff writes, “Adherence to conspiracy theory might not always be the result of some perceived lack of control, but rather a deep-seated need for uniqueness.” In Imhoff’s study, he presented American conspiracy theorists with made-up “facts” about a conspiracy regarding smoke detectors in Germany. When he told this group that 81 percent of the German population believed the theory of the conspiracy, they weren’t nearly as interested or enthusiastic as when they heard that only 19 percent of the population supported the theory. By rooting for the overlooked underdog, the conspiracy theorist engages with his desired emotion, that of feeling unique, a brave truth-teller, the outsider. This group doesn’t see themselves as kooks. Each member doesn’t have a unique theory, all alone in a field. Instead, they seek to be part of a small group, a minority group, an outspoken group that can take solace in each other while the outside world ignores them. They can find this feeling every time they hang out with the other reptile-spotters. That’s not that big a leap from the countless micro-tribes that so many early adopters belong to. Sooner or later, each of us becomes (for a while) the kind of person who believes in the reptile people that control the earth. We’re seeking our own little pocket of uniqueness

## 🧠 Summary  
Conspiracy theorists don’t pursue facts—they pursue **feelings**. Professor Roland Imhoff’s research shows that belief in conspiracy theories often stems from a **deep desire to feel unique**, not from a need for accuracy or logic. People cling to contradictory theories because the thrill lies not in consistency, but in belonging to a small, special group that “knows the truth” others don’t. This emotional drive mirrors the motivation of many **early adopters** and micro-tribes: the pursuit of identity through uniqueness.

## 💡 Key Insights  
- Conspiracy theories are emotionally driven, not fact-based.  
- People may believe mutually exclusive ideas (e.g., Diana is both alive and murdered).  
- **The appeal lies in feeling unique**, special, and “in on something.”  
- Belief strengthens when the idea is unpopular (19% believed = more appeal than 81%).  
- Conspiracy theorists **aren’t loners**—they’re part of **tight micro-tribes**.  
- These dynamics parallel the behavior of early adopters who also crave belonging and uniqueness.  
- We all, at some point, seek a small tribe that makes us feel like we *get it* while the rest of the world doesn’t.

## 🧩 Applications to any business  
- **People often seek feelings, not facts**: Customers, like conspiracy theorists, may value how something makes them feel—unique, smart, part of a special group—over whether it’s objectively true or effective.
- **Appeal to the need for uniqueness**: Products and brands can resonate more when they help customers feel like insiders or members of an exclusive tribe.
- **Small, passionate groups drive momentum**: Like conspiracy believers, niche audiences are often more engaged and loyal. Businesses can build strong communities around uncommon beliefs or preferences.
- **Social identity plays a big role**: People buy into ideas, products, or movements that align with how they see themselves or how they _want_ to be seen—brave, different, early, special.
- **Belonging matters**: Even “outsider” customers want to be part of _something_. Successful businesses often build micro-communities that offer connection around a shared belief or worldview.

## 🎨 Applications to My Posters/Brand  
- Highlight your brand as something only the bold or “in-the-know” people get.  
- Use phrases like:  
  - “Only real fans will get this.”  
  - “Not everyone’s going to like this. That’s the point.”  
  - “Made for the ones who see differently.”  
- Celebrate your smallest fanbase: give them an identity, a badge, a spotlight.  
- Create posters that speak to niche obsessions or cult followings (e.g., obscure references, inside jokes, underground icons).  
- Cultivate a tribe of fans who *brag* that they found you before others did.
