- [ ] Define your tribe: who exactly are your posters for? (e.g., movie geeks, series lovers, pop culture fans)
- [ ] Tailor your designs, language, and vibe just for them — not for everyone.
- [ ] Think: what emotion or memory will this poster trigger for the right person?
- [ ] Make each poster feel like a conversation, not a billboard.
- [ ] Write a short personal story or behind-the-scenes post for at least 1 reel this week.
- [ ] Let followers vote on a poster color scheme or quote this week.
- [ ] Use storytelling in your product captions to explain what each piece *represents*.
- [ ] Remember: Each poster isn’t just a product — it’s a vibe, a memory, or a mood people are buying.
- [ ] Write captions that highlight how a poster connects with your audience's emotions or identity.
- [ ] Stop chasing trends just for views. Ask: *Does this piece solve a creative or emotional need?
