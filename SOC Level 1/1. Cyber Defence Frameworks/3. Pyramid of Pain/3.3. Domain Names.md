# 🌐 Domain Names as Indicators in Cybersecurity

## 🧱 Pyramid of Pain: Domain Names

### 🟦 Teal Indicator
- One step above IP addresses in the Pyramid of Pain.
- More difficult for attackers to change than IPs.

## 🔗 What is a Domain Name?

- Domain names **map IP addresses** to human-readable strings.
  - Example:
    - Basic: `evilcorp.com`
    - Subdomain: `tryhackme.evilcorp.com`
- Typically consists of:
  - Subdomain (optional)
  - Domain
  - Top-Level Domain (TLD)

> 🧠 Learn more about DNS in the "DNS in Detail" Room.

## 🧪 Why Are Domain Names Used?

- Domain names are more persistent than IPs.
- Attackers must:
  - Purchase/register domain names.
  - Configure/modify DNS records.

> ⚠️ Caveat: Many DNS providers offer lax standards and APIs, **making it easier for attackers** to rotate domains dynamically.

## 🔐 What is Punycode?

> Per **Jamf**:  
> _"Punycode is a way of converting words that cannot be written in ASCII into a Unicode ASCII encoding."_

### 🧨 Example
- Display: `adıdas.de`
- Punycode: `http://xn--addas-o4a.de/`

> Modern browsers like **Chrome**, **Safari**, and **Edge** now handle Punycode translation more securely.

## 🔍 Detecting Malicious Domains

- ✅ Use **proxy logs** and **web server logs**.
- 🔗 Watch out for **URL shorteners** used to mask malicious domains.

### 🚩 Common URL Shortener Services
- `bit.ly`
- `goo.gl`
- `ow.ly`
- `s.id`
- `smarturl.it`
- `tiny.pl`
- `tinyurl.com`
- `x.co`

## 💡 Defender Tip
- Domain names are more effective indicators than IPs.
- Look for:
  - Newly registered domains.
  - Misspelled brand names (typosquatting).
  - Suspicious TLDs.
  - Obfuscated or shortened links.
