# 🧠 Threat Intelligence – Core Concepts

## 📝 Definition

**Threat Intelligence (TI)** is the **analysis of data and information** using various tools and techniques to identify **patterns, trends, and indicators** related to existing or emerging threats.  
It empowers organizations, industries, and governments to **mitigate risks** before they result in damage.

## ❓ Questions to Ask When Starting Threat Mitigation

Before diving into tools or feeds, an effective approach begins with **asking the right questions**:

- 🕵️‍♂️ Who is attacking us?
- 🎯 What are their motives?
- 🛠️ What are their capabilities?
- 🧩 What artefacts and indicators of compromise (IOCs) should we watch for?

These questions help develop a **threat context** aligned to your environment and risk appetite.


## 📦 Classifications of Threat Intelligence

Threat Intelligence is **not one-size-fits-all**. It is **classified** based on its **purpose and scope**:

### 🧭 Strategic Intelligence
- High-level intel that looks into the organisation's threat landscape and maps out the risk areas based on trends, patterns and emerging threats that may impact business decisions.
### 🔧 Technical Intelligence
- Looks into evidence and artefacts of attack used by an adversary. Incident Response teams can use this intel to create a baseline attack surface to analyse and develop defence mechanisms.

### 🕹️ Tactical Intelligence
- Assesses adversaries' tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). This intel can strengthen security controls and address vulnerabilities through real-time investigations.

### 🎯 Operational Intelligence
- Looks into an adversary's specific motives and intent to perform an attack. Security teams may use this intel to understand the critical assets available in the organisation (people, processes, and technologies) that may be targeted.

## 📖 Story Mode: The Classified Brief

Imagine you’re part of the cybersecurity team at a large logistics company, **SkyFreight**.

🛑 One day, the SIEM flags repeated failed login attempts from a foreign IP targeting your customs clearance portal.

Your CISO assembles a quick-response threat intel cell.

### 🔍 Operational Intel
Ravi, your intel analyst, traces the IP to a known **hacktivist group** protesting international shipping. Their Telegram channels suggest they plan to disrupt trade portals.

- **Motive**: Political protest.
- **Target**: Customs APIs and portals.
- **Assets at risk**: API keys, client data.

### 🕹️ Tactical Intel
Using MITRE ATT&CK mapping, the team identifies TTPs:
- Brute-force attacks on exposed login portals.
- Use of automated tools like Hydra.
- Switching IPs via a VPN provider to evade blacklists.

### 🔧 Technical Intel
Ravi pulls the group’s **IOCs** from an open-source threat feed:
- 3 IPs
- 2 User-Agent strings
- SHA256 of a brute-force script.

These get blocked via WAF and firewall rules.

### 🧭 Strategic Intel
Your CISO compiles a one-page brief to present to the board:
- “We’re seeing an increase in politically motivated threats. Recommend an annual third-party pentest, and reallocate budget toward API access controls and geofencing.”

🧠 From detection to boardroom decisions, all four classifications of Threat Intelligence came into play.
