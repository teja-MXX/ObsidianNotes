# 🔐 Hashing in Cybersecurity

## 📌 Definition (Per Microsoft)
A **hash value** is a numeric value of a fixed length that uniquely identifies data.  
It is the output of a **hashing algorithm**.

## ⚙️ Common Hashing Algorithms

### 🧱 MD5 (Message Digest 5)
- 📅 Designed by Ron Rivest in **1992**
- 🔢 Produces a **128-bit** hash (32-character hex)
- 📜 Defined in **RFC 1321**
- ❌ **Not cryptographically secure**
- 🔓 Vulnerable to **collision attacks**
- 📜 See: **RFC 6151** (Updated Security Considerations for MD5)

### 🛡️ SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1)
- 🧠 Invented by **NSA** in **1995**
- 🔢 Produces a **160-bit** hash (40-character hex)
- 📜 Defined in **RFC 3174**
- ⚠️ **Deprecated by NIST** in 2011
- ❌ Susceptible to **brute-force attacks**
- 🔒 Use discouraged for **digital signatures**

### 🧬 SHA-2 Family
- 🧠 Developed by **NIST & NSA** in **2001**
- 🔢 Most common variant: **SHA-256**
- ✅ Produces a **256-bit** hash (64-character hex)
- 📌 Recommended replacement for SHA-1

## 🚨 Hash Collisions
A hash is **not cryptographically secure** if:
- Two different files produce the **same hash value**.

## 🔍 Use of Hashes in Cybersecurity

### 📂 File & Malware Identification
Security analysts use hash values to:
- Identify malicious files
- Track malware samples
- Reference known threats

### 📰 Where Hashes Appear
- Threat intel reports (e.g., **DFIR Report**, **Trellix Threat Research Blogs**)
- Often listed at the end as **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**

### 🔧 Hash Lookup Tools
- 🔎 [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/)
- 🛡️ [Metadefender Cloud - OPSWAT](https://metadefender.opswat.com/)

## 🧠 Threat Hunting with Hashes

### ✅ Advantage
- A known hash = easy identification of a threat

### ❗ Limitation
- **Even 1-bit change** → different hash
- Attackers can easily modify malware to avoid detection
- 🔁 Many **variants** make **hash-only hunting** less effective

> 🎯 Hashes should be **part of a larger IOC strategy**, not the only tool.
