# In Search of better
## 📔Book
>The Beer Advocate website lists 250 beers that have earned more than 3,400 ratings each. Each beer is someone’s favorite. It’s possible that there are thousands of beers in the United States that are someone’s favorite. How can that be? Because taste matters. Everyone else is wrong. When a marketer arrives and says, “This is better,” he’s wrong. He actually means, “This is better for someone and it might be better for you.”

## 📝 Summary  
The Beer Advocate site lists hundreds of beers, each with thousands of ratings. Despite so many options, every beer is someone's favorite. This highlights how subjective taste is. A marketer claiming something is "better" is not universally right—they only mean it's better for someone specific.

## 💡 Key Insights  
- Taste is subjective; preferences vary wildly across people.  
- There’s no such thing as “universally better”—only “better for someone.”  
- Successful marketing doesn’t appeal to everyone, just the right people.  
- Trying to be universally liked often dilutes uniqueness and appeal.

## 🧠 Applications to Any Business  
- Tailor products and messaging to specific audience preferences, not mass appeal.  
- Accept that not everyone will like what you offer—and that’s okay.  
- Focus on building loyal fans instead of trying to win over skeptics.  
- Frame marketing with clarity: “This is for you if you believe/want…” rather than “This is better.”

## 🎨 Applications to My Posters/Graphic Design Business  
- Design with specific audiences in mind—don’t try to please everyone.  
- Accept polarizing designs; they stand out more and resonate deeper with niche audiences.  
- Promote posters with messaging like “For those who love…” instead of “This is the best…”  
- Create collections for distinct tastes (e.g., retro lovers, anime fans, movie buffs) and market accordingly.
