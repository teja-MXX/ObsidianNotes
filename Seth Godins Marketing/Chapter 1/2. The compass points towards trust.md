# 🧭 The Compass Points Toward Trust — Seth Godin Summary

## 📔 Book
```book
The compass points toward trust Every three hundred thousand years or so, the north pole and the south pole switch places. The magnetic fields of the Earth flip. In our culture, it happens more often than that. And in the world of culture change, it just happened. The true north, the method that works best, has flipped. Instead of selfish mass, effective marketing now relies on empathy and service. In this book, we’re working together to solve a set of related problems. How to spread your ideas. How to make the impact you seek. How to improve the culture. There isn’t an obvious road map. No simple step-by-step series of tactics. But what I can promise you is a compass: a true north. A recursive method that will get better the more you use it. This book is based on a hundred-day seminar, one that involves not just lessons but peer-to-peer coaching around shared work. In TheMarketingSeminar.com we assemble thousands of marketers and challenge them to go deeper, to share their journey, to challenge each other to see what truly works. As you read through, don’t hesitate to backtrack, to redo an assumption, to question an existing practice—you can adjust, test, measure, and repeat. Marketing is one of our greatest callings. It’s the work of positive change. I’m thrilled that you’re on this journey, and I hope you’ll find the tools you need here.

## 📌 Summary

Seth Godin explains that just like the Earth’s magnetic poles flip, **our cultural compass has shifted** — especially in marketing. The new "true north" is no longer about mass, selfish promotion. It’s about **empathy, trust, and service**. Marketing today is a journey, not a formula. There’s no step-by-step map, but there is a **compass** — a mindset and a method that improves the more you apply it with reflection and iteration.

## 🎯 Serve, Don’t Shout

- [ ] Create a value reel (e.g., “how I turn pop culture into posters” or “tips to decorate your room with art”).

## 🤝 Involve Your Audience
- [ ] Let followers vote on a poster color scheme or quote this week.
- [ ] Share fan stories or photos of people who bought your poster (with permission).
- [ ] Use the phrase “Made for fans of ___” in captions to help people self-identify.

## 🌟 Make a Cultural Impact

- [ ] Remember: Each poster isn’t just a product — it’s a vibe, a memory, or a mood people are buying.
