>But which market? Which people? If you have to choose a thousand people to become your true fans, who should you choose? Begin by choosing people based on what they dream of, believe, and want, not based on what they look like. In other words, use psychographics instead of demographics. Just as you can group people by the color of their eyes or the length of their ring fingers, you can group them based on the stories they tell themselves. Cognitive linguist George Lakoff calls these clumps worldviews. A worldview is the shortcut, the lens each of us uses when we see the world. It’s our assumptions and biases and yes, stereotypes about the world around us. Loyal Fox News viewers have a worldview. So do fox hunters. So do people who show up at the midnight screening of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Everyone deserves to be treated as an individual, with dignity and respect for their choices. But as marketers, we must begin with a worldview, and invite people who share that worldview to join us. “I made this” is a very different statement than, “What do you want?” We can make pretty good assumptions about how someone will react or respond to a piece of news or a work of art if we have evidence about their worldview. When Ron Johnson was hired as CEO of JCPenney in 2011, one of his first acts was to end the constant stream of discounts and urgent sales that the store was always pitching to its customers. Johnson took that action based on his worldview, on his bias about how to shop. He didn’t think it was possible that a quality retailer, a store he’d like to shop in, would be constantly pitching clearances, coupons, and discounts, and so he tried to transform JCPenney into his kind of store. As a result, sales plummeted by more than 50 percent. Coming from his previous position as senior vice president of retail operations at Apple, Johnson saw the world of retail through a lens of elegance, of quiet, mutual respect. He was a luxury goods buyer, and he liked selling luxury goods as well. As a result of his worldview, he abandoned Penney’s true fans: people who loved the sport of bargain hunting. Or the urgency. People whose worldviews differed from his. Penney’s customers were playing a game, one that made them feel like they were winning. Yes, we’re typecasting—willfully exaggerating people’s attitudes and beliefs in order to serve them better. A convenient shortcut in this exercise is to identify the different personas we might encounter. There’s Bargain Bill, who’s playing a sport when he shops at the same time he wrestles with his narrative about money. And there’s Hurried Henry, who is always looking for a shortcut and is rarely willing to wait in line, read the directions, or think it through, at least not when he’s traveling for business. Next to him in line, though, is Careful Karla, who’s suspicious of the cab driver, sure that she’s going to get ripped off by the desk clerk, and would never drink out of the hotel mini bar. Everyone has a problem, a desire, and a narrative. Who will you seek to serve?

## 1. 🎯 Summary of the Original Excerpt

To truly connect and serve an audience, don’t focus on demographics like age or location—focus on _psychographics_: people’s beliefs, desires, fears, and worldviews. These internal narratives shape how they respond to products, stories, or art. As marketers or creators, we typecast or define _personas_ (e.g., Bargain Bill or Careful Karla) to better understand and serve distinct groups. Misjudging their worldview—like Ron Johnson did with JCPenney—can lead to disaster. Every person has a problem, a desire, and a story they tell themselves. The question is: _who do you want to serve?_

## 3. 🖼️ Applications to Poster Business / Graphic Designing

- **Create personas for your niche audience**:
    - 🎭 _Rebel Ravi_: Loves anti-establishment themes, bold fonts, chaos.
    - 💼 _Minimalist Maya_: Wants clean design, philosophical quotes, soft tones.
    - 🕹 _Retro Ramesh_: Feeds on nostalgia—8-bit, neon, old Bollywood lines.
    - 💔 _Melancholic Meera_: Craves dark colors, poetic sadness, tragic icons.
        
- **Align your poster themes with their worldviews**:
    - “Life is a game” → Gamified poster styles.
    - “Rules are meant to be broken” → Punk-inspired collage art.
    - “Less is more” → Minimalist color-block posters with few words.
    - “Only the nostalgic survive” → Vintage filters + cult icon posters.
        
- **Avoid creating for everyone**. A clean design might bore Rebel Ravi. A loud meme poster may annoy Minimalist Maya.
