It’s tempting to decide that there’s a transitive relationship, that A > B > C. This works, for example, with length. A ruler is longer than a thumb and a thumb is longer than a peppercorn, and therefore a ruler is longer than a peppercorn. But linear comparisons don’t make sense when we’re building stories and opportunities for humans. An Hermès bag is more expensive than a Louis Vuitton bag, which is more expensive than one from Coach. But that doesn’t mean that the Hermès bag is “better.” It merely means that it’s more expensive, which is just one of the many things that someone might care about. Expense might be easy to measure, but it’s never clear that more of it is always better. What about more subjective categories like “stylish” or “fashionable” or “status”? Suddenly, it’s not linear. Not easy to measure. Not clear at all what better means

## 📝 Summary  
Not everything can or should be compared linearly. When it comes to human preferences like fashion, style, or brand value, there is no universal "better." What’s better for one person might not be for another. "Better" becomes a subjective story, not an objective measure.

## 💡 Key Insights  
- Linear comparisons (A > B > C) don’t apply to emotional or subjective domains.  
- Expense does not equate to "better"; it's just one metric among many.  
- People's perception of value is based on personal meaning, not objective facts.  
- Marketers should resist pushing “this is better” and instead understand what “better” means to each specific person.

## 🧠 Applications to Any Business  
- Don’t position your product or service as objectively “better”—position it as “better for *someone* with these values or needs.”  
- Acknowledge that taste, style, and preference are not universal; they’re personal.  
- Your job is to tell a story that aligns with what matters to your audience.  
- Avoid comparison traps; focus instead on emotional resonance and relevance.

## 🎨 Applications to My Posters/Graphic Design Business  
- Stop comparing your work with others in terms of price, followers, or complexity.  
- Focus on how your art makes someone *feel*, not how it ranks.  
- Embrace that your work isn’t for everyone—it’s for those who vibe with your style.  
- Let your visual storytelling define “better,” not pricing or popularity.
