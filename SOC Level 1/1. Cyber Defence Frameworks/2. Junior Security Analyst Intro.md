# 🛡️ Security Operations Center (SOC) Overview

## 🎯 Core Function of a SOC
The **Security Operations Center (SOC)** operates 24/7 to:
- 🧠 Investigate threats
- 👀 Monitor network and systems
- 🚫 Prevent attacks
- ⚡ Respond to security incidents

> 🗨️ Per McAfee:  
> "Security operations teams are charged with monitoring and protecting many assets, such as intellectual property, personnel data, business systems, and brand integrity."

![[Pasted image 20250508185430.png]]

SOC teams serve as the **implementation arm** of an organization's cybersecurity framework and centralize:
- Monitoring
- Assessment
- Defensive coordination

👥 **Team size** varies by organizational scale.

# 🛡️ Story: A Night in the SOC

It was a quiet Tuesday night shift in the NovaApps Security Operations Center, and Arjun, a fresh Junior Security Analyst barely four months into the role, sat hunched over his multiple monitors. The SOC’s bluish glow reflected off his glasses, and the only sound was the soft humming of machines and the occasional clack of his keyboard. His job was clear—monitor the incoming alerts, analyze logs, triage anything suspicious, and escalate incidents that seemed beyond his scope. It wasn’t glamorous, but it was essential. That night, something caught his eye—an alert flagged by the SIEM: a successful login to one of the production Windows servers via RDP, originating from an IP address in Belarus. Arjun's heart picked up pace. He pulled the logs immediately. There were six failed login attempts before the successful one, all within a 3-minute window. To someone not trained in TCP/IP or remote access patterns, it might look like a glitch. But Arjun knew this could be an attempted brute-force login. He checked the event timeline—the user was typically active from Bengaluru, not Eastern Europe, and never during graveyard hours.

Using his knowledge of the OSI and TCP/IP models, he followed the trail: the connection was made over port 3389, standard for RDP. A quick DNS query showed the IP wasn’t part of any sanctioned VPN pool. He cross-checked internal logs and spotted that the account had accessed an internal web application’s admin panel—a level of access it normally didn’t require. His fingers flew over the keyboard as he opened a ticket and began documenting everything, step by step, tagging it for visibility. While writing, he mentally replayed the drill: confirm the alert, investigate, and escalate if needed. This, he knew, was the heart of a Tier 1 SOC analyst’s job—first eyes on the threat, doing basic investigation, and calling in reinforcements when things got serious.

He sent the ticket to Tier 2, making sure to note: "Possible credential compromise. Unauthorized RDP login from Belarus. Accessed internal panel. Recommend deeper investigation." He knew that beyond this point, someone with more experience would take over—maybe conduct packet captures, correlate additional telemetry, and coordinate with the endpoint team if needed. Still, he wasn’t done. Curious, Arjun dug a little deeper. He checked MITRE ATT&CK mappings and ran a quick scan on threat intel feeds he subscribed to through Feedly. The IP matched a recent post flagged by a known CTI source. He tweeted the IOC from his anonymous cyber account and bookmarked it. This was the part no one mentioned in job descriptions—how much real-time learning happened in the flow.

When the morning team arrived, they held the usual SOC sync. The Tier 2 analyst, Rhea, commended Arjun’s catch. Her investigation revealed that the attacker had used a well-known tool—BluePassCrack—to brute-force weak passwords. No malware was dropped, but the attacker had made attempts to enumerate the network after login. IT had already disabled the compromised account. By afternoon, Tier 3 had taken over to perform forensic analysis, extracting volatile memory from the target system, and built new IDS signatures to detect similar behavior. They even created a custom YARA rule.

Arjun sat back, quietly proud. He wasn’t the hero of the story, but he had spotted the first clue, the kind that gets missed in endless noise. This was the job—a constant watch, pattern recognition, and sharp escalation. Later that day, he updated his personal notes in Obsidian. He reflected on the OSI model again, revised how TCP works during login sessions, and bookmarked a GitHub repo with Snort rules. He even practiced writing a basic IDS signature—something his team lead had encouraged him to try.

He made a to-do list: study up more on intrusion detection, finish the next chapter of his Security+ guide, and maybe take a stab at writing a custom detection rule for multiple failed RDP logins from the same IP. The path ahead was long—Tier 2, then maybe threat hunting with Tier 3—but tonight, he had done what mattered. He had seen the smoke and called the fire crew before it became an inferno. And that, he thought as he packed his bag and handed over the shift, is how a Junior Security Analyst begins.
