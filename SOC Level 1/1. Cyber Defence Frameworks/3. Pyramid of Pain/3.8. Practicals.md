# 🧱 Pyramid of Pain – APT Detection Exercise Checklist

## 📌 Objective
Apply the Pyramid of Pain framework to analyze an APT group and design effective detection strategies based on their indicators and behaviors.

---

## 🔍 Step 1: Select an APT Group
- [ ] Visit [MITRE ATT&CK APT Groups](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/) or [Rapid7 Threat Groups](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/)
- [ ] Choose an APT group to investigate (e.g., APT28, APT29, Lazarus Group)
- [ ] Note down the group's known aliases and origins
- [ ] Identify primary attack goals (espionage, financial, destruction)

---

## 📦 Step 2: Gather Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

### 🟩 Green Zone – Low Pain (Easy to Change)
- [ ] File hash values (e.g., MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256)
- [ ] IP addresses
- [ ] Domain names (including Punycode and URL shorteners)

### 🟨 Yellow Zone – Medium Pain (Moderate to Change)
- [ ] Host Artifacts (e.g., registry keys, scheduled tasks, startup entries)
- [ ] Network Artifacts (e.g., User-Agent strings, URI patterns, C2 protocols)

### 🟥 Red Zone – High Pain (Hard to Change)
- [ ] Tools used (e.g., Cobalt Strike, Mimikatz, custom EXEs/DLLs)
- [ ] TTPs – Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (MITRE ATT&CK matrix)

---

## 🧠 Step 3: Map to Pyramid of Pain
For each IOC:
- [ ] Identify the Pyramid of Pain level (Green / Yellow / Red)
- [ ] Ask: _How difficult would it be for the attacker to change this?_
- [ ] Prioritize detections from **Yellow and Red** zones

---

## 🧰 Step 4: Create Detection Rules and Approaches

### 🔒 What to monitor:
- [ ] Endpoint logs (Windows Event Logs, Sysmon, EDR)
- [ ] Network traffic (Proxy logs, Firewall, PCAPs)
- [ ] DNS queries and responses
- [ ] File system and process activity

### 🛡️ Detection techniques:
- [ ] Write YARA rules for tool/malware signatures
- [ ] Use Sigma rules for SIEM alerts
- [ ] Create IDS/IPS rules (e.g., Snort, Suricata)
- [ ] Correlate behavior with MITRE ATT&CK techniques

## 📝 Reflection Questions
- [ ] What kind of indicators are easiest to detect?
- [ ] What kinds of indicators would frustrate or stop the attacker?
- [ ] How could I integrate this detection into my existing defense tools?
