> Even in a democracy, a situation where second place rarely pays off, the idea of “everyone” is a mistake. I was talking with two congressional campaign organizers, and they kept talking about getting the message out to everyone, connecting with everyone, getting everyone to the polls. I did a little research and discovered that in the last primary in that district, only twenty thousand people voted, which means that in a contested primary, getting five thousand people to the polls is the difference between winning and losing. The district has 724,000 residents; five thousand people is less than 1 percent of that. There’s a very big difference between five thousand and “everyone.” And for your work, five thousand of the right people might well be more than enough.

## **🔥 Summary**  
The myth of “everyone” is dangerous. Real change and success don’t require the approval of the masses—they require the _right few_. In politics, business, and creativity, trying to reach everyone waters down your message. Instead, focus on the smallest group that can create the biggest impact.

## **📱 Instagram-Specific To-Do List**

- [ ] **Create a carousel post**: “Why I Don’t Design for Everyone (And Neither Should You)”

- [ ] **Poll your audience**: “Which fandom are you loyal to?” — Then design specifically for the top 2 responses.

- [ ] **Reel idea**: “You only need 5,000 people to win. Not 5 million views.” Use simple motion graphics.

- [ ] **Story prompt**: “Tag someone who’d _actually_ get this poster” – niche audiences love in- jokes.

- [ ] **Pin your most niche-loved poster** with a caption that explains who it’s _really_ for.

- [ ] **Create a ‘Only Real Ones Know’ product line** — designs only insiders will get.
