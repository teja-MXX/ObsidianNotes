Marketing in five steps The first step is to invent a thing worth making, with a story worth telling, and a contribution worth talking about. The second step is to design and build it in a way that a few people will particularly benefit from and care about. The third step is to tell a story that matches the built-in narrative and dreams of that tiny group of people, the smallest viable market. The fourth step is the one everyone gets excited about: spread the word. The last step is often overlooked: show up—regularly, consistently, and generously, for years and years—to organize and lead and build confidence in the change you seek to make. To earn permission to follow up and to earn enrollment to teach. As marketers, we get to consistently do the work to help the idea spread from person to person, engaging a tribe as you make change happen.

## 📌 Summary
Marketing is not just about promotion — it's a step-by-step journey that begins long before “spreading the word.” Seth Godin outlines five clear steps: start with something remarkable, design it for a few who’ll love it, craft the right story, share it authentically, and — the most vital yet overlooked step — *show up consistently for the long haul.* Marketing is a long-term commitment to change, not a shortcut to sales.

## 🎨 Applications to Poster Business
- **Start with a killer idea, not a trending visual**  
  → What’s the *real* message behind this poster? Why will someone hang it up?

- **Design for your "few"**  
  → Create for the niche that vibes with your values — pop culture nerds, movie geeks, rebels, designers, etc.

- **Narrate what they already feel**  
  → Posters should echo internal stories: nostalgia, identity, rebellion, dreams.

- **Grow community, not just followers**  
  → Encourage conversations, collaborations, and reposts with depth, not clickbait.

- **Show up like a trusted voice**  
  → Be the artist they count on — post regularly, write boldly, create sincerely.
