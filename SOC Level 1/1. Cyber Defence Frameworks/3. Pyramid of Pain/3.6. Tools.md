# 🛠️ Tools (Orange Zone) – Pyramid of Pain

## 🟧 Orange Indicator
- At this level, attackers face **significant disruption**.
- Detection here typically means the attacker must:
  - 🔁 Rebuild or redevelop their tools
  - 💸 Spend resources (time, money, effort)
  - 📉 Possibly abandon the intrusion attempt altogether

---

## 🛠️ What Are "Tools" in This Context?

These are **custom or public utilities** attackers use to:
- 📄 Create malicious macro documents (maldocs)
- 🐚 Drop remote shells or backdoors
- 🖥️ Deliver .EXE or .DLL payloads
- 🔓 Crack passwords or escalate privileges

---

## 🛡️ How to Detect Them?

### ✅ Detection Mechanisms:
- 🔍 **Antivirus Signatures**
- 🔎 **YARA Rules** – Match strings/patterns in files
- 🧠 **Detection Rules** – Custom logic for SIEM/EDR/IDS
- 🔬 **Fuzzy Hashing** – Find **similar tools** with small changes (e.g. `SSDeep`)

## 🧰 Tools & Platforms for Detection

### 🔬 Malware Sample & Analysis Repos:
- **[MalwareBazaar](https://bazaar.abuse.ch)**
- **[Malshare](https://malshare.com)**

### 📘 Detection Rules Marketplace:
- **[SOC Prime Threat Detection Marketplace](https://tdm.socprime.com)** – CVEs, rule sharing, threat insights

### 🧮 Fuzzy Hashing:
- **[SSDeep](https://ssdeep-project.github.io/)** – Similarity analysis for binaries and files
- Helps detect *variants* of previously seen malicious tools

---

## 🧠 Why Is This Important?

- Detecting tools **breaks the attack chain early**.
- Reduces the chance for lateral movement, persistence, and data exfiltration.
- Makes reuse of attacker tooling ineffective across multiple targets.
