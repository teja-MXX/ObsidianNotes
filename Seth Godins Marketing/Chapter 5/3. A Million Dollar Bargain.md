>Consider the plight of the nonprofit fundraiser. She’s trying to raise a million dollars to pay for a new building on campus. Every time she’s meeting with a foundation or a philanthropist and an objection is raised, she says to herself, “You’re right, that’s a crazy amount of money. I’d never give a million dollars to charity—I have enough trouble paying my rent.” And so the donation doesn’t get made. Empathy changes this dynamic. Because the donation isn’t for her, it’s for the donor. It’s for the donor who says to himself, “This million-dollar donation is a bargain. I’m going to get at least two million dollars’ worth of joy, status, and satisfaction out of this decision.” And that’s okay. It’s the way choice works. Everything that we purchase—every investment, every trinket, every experience—is a bargain. That’s why we bought it. Because it was worth more than what we paid for it. Otherwise, we wouldn’t buy it. Which means, going back to the hapless fundraiser, that if you’re unwilling to have empathy for the narrative of the person you seek to serve, you’re stealing. You’re stealing because you’re withholding a valuable option. You’re keeping someone from understanding how much they’ll benefit from what you’ve created . . . such a significant benefit that it’s a bargain. If they understand what’s on offer and choose not to buy it, then it’s not for them. Not today, not at this price, not with that structure. That’s okay too.

## 📝 Summary  
The nonprofit fundraiser fails not because the ask is too big, but because she lacks empathy for the donor’s perspective. People give or buy when the value they perceive exceeds the cost. Every decision is based on perceived value, not the seller’s doubts. Marketing requires understanding how valuable your offer feels to the other person—not you.

- Don’t talk yourself out of a sale because *you* wouldn’t buy it—your customer isn’t you.

## 🎨 Applications to My Posters/Graphic Design Business  
- Don’t price or market based on your own hesitations; think about the value *they* get—vibe, mood, personality expression, decor.  
- Showcase how your poster makes their room, office, or life feel better.  
- Think: Does this make them smile? Feel cool? Seen? Then it’s a bargain.  
- Add value through messaging, packaging, and experience that makes the purchase feel more meaningful than the cost.
