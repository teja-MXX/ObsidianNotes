## 📔 Book

>_Innovative marketers invent new solutions that work with old emotions_
> While the seven billion people on this planet are each unique, each a different collection of wants, needs, pain, and joy, in many ways we’re all the same. We share a basket of dreams and desires, all in different proportions, but with a ton of overlap. 
> Here’s the list, the foundational list, a shared vocabulary that each of us chooses from when expressing our dreams and fears: 
> 1. Adventure 
> 2. Affection 
> 3. Avoiding new things 
> 4. Belonging 
> 5. Community 
> 6. Control 
> 7. Creativity 
> 8. Delight 
> 9. Freedom of expression 
> 10. Freedom of movement 
> 11. Friendship 
> 12. Good looks 
> 13. Health 
> 14. Learning new things 
> 15. Luxury 
> 16. Nostalgia 
> 17. Obedience 
> 18. Participation 
> 19. Peace of mind 
> 20. Physical activity 
> 21. Power 
> 22. Reassurance 
> 23. Reliability 
> 24. Respect 
> 25. Revenge 
> 26. Romance 
> 27. Safety 
> 28. Security 
> 29. Sex 
> 30. Strength 
> 31. Sympathy 
> 32. Tension Y
> 
> You could probably add ten more. But it’s unlikely you could add fifty more. This core basket of dreams and desires means that marketers, like artists, don’t need many colors to paint an original masterpiece. 
> And this is where we begin: with assertions. Assertions about what our audience, the folks we need to serve, want and need. Assertions about what’s on their minds when they wake up, what they talk about when no one is eavesdropping, what they remember at the end of the day. 
> And then we make assertions about how our story and our promise will interact with these wants and desires. When someone encounters us, will they see what we see? Will they want what we think they’ll want? Will they take action? 
> Don’t begin with your machines, your inventory, or your tactics. Don’t begin with what you know how to do or some sort of distraction about your mission. Instead, begin with dreams and fears, with emotional states, and with the change your customers seek

## 📝 **Summary:**

While each person is unique, our desires are built from a **shared emotional palette**. The most innovative marketers don’t invent new feelings—they invent new ways to **trigger familiar ones**. Instead of starting with features, start with _feelings_. Don’t sell what you make. Sell how it makes people **feel**.

---
## 🔑 **Key Insights:**

- The most powerful marketing speaks to **universal emotions**.
- Every customer wants to feel something—**not buy something**.
- Emotions like **belonging, safety, freedom, power, control, nostalgia, and romance** are timeless triggers.
- Start with **assertions**—about what your audience wants, fears, dreams, and needs.
- Your **product is just the delivery vehicle** for an emotional transformation.

## 💼 Applications to Any Business:

- Identify **what emotional shift** your product enables (e.g., anxious → confident).
- Replace “What should we build?” with “What change should we enable?”
- Market the **transformation**, not the tool.
- Begin brainstorming with questions like:
    - “What fear does this product soothe?”
    - “What dream does this poster or item speak to?”

## 🎨 Applications to Poster/Graphic Design Business:

- Every design should **trigger a feeling**:
    - “Nostalgia” → retro palettes, old Bollywood references, analog textures.
    - “Power” → bold typography, iconic figures, punchy quotes.
    - “Belonging” → community memes, fan moments, shared symbols.
- Add an emotional prompt to every poster caption:
    > “This one’s for the ones who still remember…” (Nostalgia)  
    > “For those who don’t just dream—they do.” (Ambition/Power)

## 👕 Applications to Shirts Apparel Business:

- Every shirt should **stand for a feeling**.
- Don’t sell “oversized shirt with funky print.” Sell “comfort with a rebellious streak” or “a hug that screams individuality.”
- Align collections to emotions:
    - **Nostalgia Drop** → retro TV, 2000s icons, ‘your childhood on cotton’
    - **Power Drop** → monochrome fits with bold messages
    - **Love Drop** → minimalist romantic prints, soft cotton, gift-focused marketing    
- Caption idea:
    > “It’s not just a shirt. It’s a flag for your kind of people.”

## 📖 Brand Story: _The Drop that Hugged Everyone_

Aayushi, brand manager for a rising apparel line, noticed that every brand was talking about fabric GSMs and stitching styles. But what customers commented on was something else: _“This shirt feels like home.”_
So for the next drop, she didn’t lead with designs. She led with a feeling.
She called it: **The “Safe Space” Drop**.
Every shirt was printed with comforting words, earthy tones, and slightly loose fits. She promoted it like therapy—**"For the overthinkers. For the ones who feel too much. For the ones who just need one shirt that doesn’t demand anything from them."**
The drop _exploded_.
People cried in the DMs. One reel had a girl saying, “I don’t know why, but I needed this.”
**Moral:** The product didn’t change. But the emotion they anchored it in? That made all the difference.
