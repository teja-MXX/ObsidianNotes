>Old-fashioned industrial marketing is built around the person who pays for the ads. It’s done to the customer, not for him or her. Traditional marketing uses pressure, bait and switch, and any available coercive methods to make the sale— to land the client, to get the money, to sign on the line that is dotted. When the customer has no choice but to listen to you and engage with you, when there are only three TV channels, only one store in town, only a few choices, the race to the bottom is the race worth winning. But the newly empowered consumer has discovered that what looks like clutter to the marketer feels like choice. They’ve come to realize that there are an infinite number of choices, an endless parade of alternatives. For the marketer, it’s like trying to sell sand in a desert. A million books published every year. More than five hundred kinds of battery chargers on Amazon. More coaches, courses, and clubs than they could ever consider, never mind hire or join. Surrounded by this tsunami of choice, most of it offered by folks who are simply selfish, the consumer has made an obvious choice. Walk away
