# Market-driven: Who’s driving the bus?

## 📘 Book Section

> Every organization—every project—is influenced by a primary driving force.  
> Some restaurants are chef-driven. Silicon Valley is often tech-driven.  
> Investment firms in New York are money-driven, focused on the share price or the latest financial manipulation.  
> The driver, whichever one you choose, is the voice that gets heard the clearest, and the person with that voice is the one who gets to sit at the head of the table.  
> Often, organizations are marketing-driven. They’re slick, focused on the offer, the surface shine, the ability to squeeze out one more dollar.  
> I’m not really interested in helping you become marketing-driven, because it’s a dead end.  
> The alternative is to be market-driven—to hear the market, to listen to it, and even more important, to influence it, to bend it, to make it better.  
> When you’re marketing-driven, you’re focused on the latest Facebook data hacks, the design of your new logo, and your Canadian pricing model.  
> On the other hand, when you’re market-driven, you think a lot about the hopes and dreams of your customers and their friends. You listen to their frustrations and invest in changing the culture.  
> Being market-driven lasts.
