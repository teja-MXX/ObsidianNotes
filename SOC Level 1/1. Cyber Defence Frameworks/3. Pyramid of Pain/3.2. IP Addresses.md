# 🌐 IP Addresses as Indicators in Cybersecurity

## 📌 What is an IP Address?
- An **IP Address** identifies a device on a network.
- Devices include: desktops, servers, **CCTV cameras**, and more.
- IP addresses are essential for **sending and receiving information** across a network.

> Note: This note doesn't go into structure or functionality of IP addresses — only their use as **indicators** in cyber defense.

## 🧱 Pyramid of Pain: IP Addresses

### 🟩 Green Indicator
- In the **Pyramid of Pain**, IP addresses are marked **green**.
- Green = **low difficulty** for adversaries to change.
- While useful to defenders, **blocking IPs alone is weak defense**.

---

## 🛡️ Defender Use Case
- Common defense tactic:
  - 🚫 Block
  - 📉 Drop
  - ❌ Deny inbound IP requests via firewalls
- Limitation:
  - 🔄 **Adversaries can quickly switch to new IPs**.
  - IP address blocking is **easily bypassed**.

## ⚙️ Fast Flux Technique

### 🕸️ What is Fast Flux?
> Per **Akamai**:  
> _"Fast Flux is a DNS technique used by botnets to hide phishing, malware delivery, and communication behind compromised hosts acting as proxies."_

### 🧠 Purpose
- Obfuscates malware infrastructure.
- Makes **Command & Control (C&C)** harder to detect or take down.
- Increases **resilience** and **evasion** against law enforcement and security monitoring.

### 🧪 How It Works
- Associates **multiple IPs** with a **single domain**.
- IP addresses **change frequently**.
- Example scenario: See Palo Alto’s *"Fast Flux 101"*.

## 🚨 Takeaway
- IP addresses are **easy to rotate**, making them a **low-value indicator**.
- Use IPs for **initial triage or correlation**, but **don’t rely solely** on them for detection or blocking.
- Combine with other Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as:
  - ✉️ Email addresses
  - 🧬 File hashes
  - 🧠 TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)
