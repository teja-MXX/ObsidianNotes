# üõ°Ô∏è Firewall Setup

The primary goal of firewalls is to provide a security mechanism for controlling and monitoring network traffic between different network segments, such as internal and external networks or different network zones. Firewalls play a crucial role in protecting computer networks from unauthorized access, malicious traffic, and other security threats.

Linux, being a popular operating system used in servers and other network devices, provides built-in firewall capabilities that can be used to control network traffic. They can filter incoming and outgoing traffic based on pre-defined rules, protocols, ports, and other criteria to prevent unauthorized access and mitigate security threats.

The specific goal of a firewall implementation can vary depending on the specific needs of the organization, such as ensuring the **confidentiality, integrity, and availability** of network resources.

## üõ†Ô∏è Historical Context: Linux Firewalls

An example from the history of Linux firewalls is the development of the **iptables** tool, which replaced the earlier **ipchains** and **ipfwadm** tools.  
- Introduced in the Linux **2.4 kernel** (2000).  
- Provided a **flexible** and **efficient** mechanism for filtering network traffic.
- Became the **de facto standard** for Linux firewall management.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Netfilter and iptables

In Linux, firewall functionality is implemented using the **Netfilter** framework, an integral part of the kernel.

- Netfilter provides **hooks** to intercept and modify network traffic.
- **iptables** is the utility commonly used to configure firewall rules on Linux systems.

# üö™ iptables Overview

The `iptables` utility provides a flexible set of rules for filtering network traffic based on:

- Source/destination IP addresses
- Port numbers
- Protocols
- Other criteria

Other solutions exist too:
- **nftables**: Modern replacement for iptables.
- **ufw** (Uncomplicated Firewall): Easier frontend for iptables.
- **firewalld**: Dynamic firewall management solution.

## üì¶ Components of iptables

| Component | Description |
|:---|:---|
| **Tables** | Organize and categorize firewall rules. |
| **Chains** | Group a set of firewall rules applied to specific traffic. |
| **Rules** | Define criteria for filtering traffic. |
| **Matches** | Criteria like IP addresses, ports, protocols, etc. |
| **Targets** | Actions for matched packets (ACCEPT, DROP, etc.) |

---

# üóÇÔ∏è Tables in iptables

Tables are used to categorize firewall rules based on the type of traffic they handle.

| Table | Description | Built-in Chains |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **filter** | Filters traffic based on IP, ports, protocols. | INPUT, OUTPUT, FORWARD |
| **nat** | Modifies source/destination IPs. | PREROUTING, POSTROUTING |
| **mangle** | Modifies packet headers. | PREROUTING, OUTPUT, INPUT, FORWARD, POSTROUTING |
| **raw** | Special packet processing options. | PREROUTING, OUTPUT |

---

# üß© Chains in iptables

Chains organize rules within a table.

### üìå Built-in Chains
- **INPUT**: Incoming packets destined for the local system.
- **OUTPUT**: Outgoing packets originating from the local system.
- **FORWARD**: Packets routed through the system.
- **PREROUTING**: Alter packets before routing.
- **POSTROUTING**: Alter packets after routing.

### üìå User-defined Chains
- Created for custom rule grouping.
- Useful for complex configurations.
- Example: A user-defined chain for HTTP traffic filtering.

# üìú Rules and Targets in iptables

Rules define **matching criteria** and **actions** for packets.

### üìå Example Rule:
Allow incoming SSH traffic on port 22:
```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
```

### üìå Common Targets
|**Target Name**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`ACCEPT`|Allows the packet to pass through the firewall and continue to its destination|
|`DROP`|Drops the packet, effectively blocking it from passing through the firewall|
|`REJECT`|Drops the packet and sends an error message back to the source address, notifying them that the packet was blocked|
|`LOG`|Logs the packet information to the system log|
|`SNAT`|Modifies the source IP address of the packet, typically used for Network Address Translation (NAT) to translate private IP addresses to public IP addresses|
|`DNAT`|Modifies the destination IP address of the packet, typically used for NAT to forward traffic from one IP address to another|
|`MASQUERADE`|Similar to SNAT but used when the source IP address is not fixed, such as in a dynamic IP address scenario|
|`REDIRECT`|Redirects packets to another port or IP address|
|`MARK`|Adds or modifies the Netfilter mark value of the packet, which can be used for advanced routing or other purposes|
## üéØ Matches in iptables
| **Match Name**          | **Description**                                                    |

| `--dport`               | Specifies the destination port to match                            |
| `--sport`               | Specifies the source port to match                                 |
| `-s` or `--source`      | Specifies the source IP address to match                           |

| `-m string`             | Matches packets that contain a specific string                     |
| `-m limit`              | Matches packets at a specified rate limit                          |
