# 🧠 **Insight: Who’s Talking?**

## 📔 Book

>_Who’s talking?_ 
>
>When you get an email from a faceless corporation, speaking in the second person, someone is hiding. It’s slick, but it’s not real. We don’t feel a connection, merely the shadow of a bureaucrat. On the other hand, when a human being extends emotional labor to take responsibility—“Here, I made this”—then the door is open to connection and growth. The most effective organizations don’t always have a famous leader or a signature on every email. But they act like they do. “Here, I made this.” The goal isn’t to personalize the work. It’s to make it personal.

## 📌 **Summary:**

In a world full of robotic, faceless communication, the brands that win are the ones that speak like _people_. Real people. Saying, _"Here, I made this,"_ opens the door to emotional connection, responsibility, and trust. It’s not about slapping your name on a newsletter. It’s about making the interaction personal, not just personalized.

## 🔑 **Key Insights:**

1. **Corporate-speak is a barrier, not a bridge.**
2. People want to feel like _someone_ is behind the message—not “the team.”
3. Saying _“Here, I made this”_ invites trust and accountability.
4. Brands that act like a single thoughtful human earn more loyalty.
5. Don’t just personalize—_make it personal._

1. **Humanize communication.**  
    Replace faceless templates with language that feels like it’s from a real person.

    Whether it’s a mistake or a milestone, use “I” or “we” in a meaningful way.
3. **Assign ownership to experiences.**  
    Make customers feel like someone _cared_ about their order or message.
4. **Remove unnecessary polish.**  
    Don’t over-slick your emails, captions, or websites—raw clarity often wins.

## 🎨 **Applications to Poster/Graphic Design Business:**

1. **Use your voice on Instagram captions.**  
    Instead of “New design out now,” try “I loved working on this one—it’s inspired by…”
2. **Behind-the-scenes reels.**  
    Show the messy desk, the pencil strokes, the decisions—_you_ made this.
3. **Write like a human, not an art gallery.**  
    People connect more with “This took 7 coffee-fueled hours” than “An exploration in surrealism.”
4. **DM personally.**  
    Say “Hey! Glad you liked the poster—I’m the one who made it 😄” when someone appreciates your work.

## 👕 **Applications to Shirts Apparel Business:**

1. **Add personal notes to orders.**  
    A short “Packed by [Your Name] – hope you love it!” sticker builds loyalty.
2. **Show the maker.**  
    Stories showing who designs, prints, or packs the shirts humanize your brand.
3. **Say 'we made this for you,' not 'we offer...'.**  
    The language of _care_ beats the language of _commerce_.
4. **Instagram bios matter.**  
    “We design shirts with stories” > “Premium shirtwear company since 2023.”

## 📖 **Story: How a Marketer Humanized a Shirt Brand**

Ravi was running ads for a local premium shirt brand. Everything was clean, polished, and utterly forgettable. Despite good product photography, email open rates were abysmal, and the Instagram page felt like a showroom, not a person.

One day, Ravi changed the game. He wrote an email that started with:

> “Hey, I’m Ravi. I help run this brand—and I wanted to show you something we’re proud of…”

He paired it with a photo of one of the tailors adjusting a cuff, captioned, “Mani’s been sewing for 17 years. He stitched this shirt.”

Engagement doubled.

Customers replied to the email. One even said: “It’s nice to finally know who’s talking to us.”

From that day, every post began with a human voice. The brand wasn’t a company—it was _Ravi, Mani, and the folks who cared enough to make you feel seen_.

That’s the power of saying: **“Here, we made this.”**
