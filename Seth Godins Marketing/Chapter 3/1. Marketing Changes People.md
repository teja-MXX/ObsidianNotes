Case Study: VisionSpring—Selling glasses to people who need them 

Each person has a story in his or her head, a narrative used to navigate the world. The extraordinary thing is that every person’s narrative is different. A few years ago, I went with a small team to a village in India, trying to understand the challenges that VisionSpring faces in their work. VisionSpring is a social enterprise that works to get reading glasses to the billion people around the world who need them but don’t have them. When the typical person only lived to thirty or forty years of age, it didn’t matter that most people will need reading glasses beginning at age fifty. But as lifespans have increased, more and more people find themselves otherwise healthy and active but unable to work—because they can’t read or do close-up work. If you’re a weaver or a jeweler or a nurse, working without glasses can be impossible. VisionSpring’s strategy is to produce attractive glasses in bulk at a very low cost, perhaps two dollars a pair. And then, working with local traveling salespeople, they bring the glasses to villages around the world, where they sell them for three dollars or so a pair. The one-dollar difference between the manufacturing cost and the price is just enough to pay for shipping, for local talent, and for the organization to keep growing. When we set up our table in the village, many people came to see what was going on. It was the middle of a very hot day and there wasn’t much else to do. The men were wearing traditional Indian work shirts, embroidered, each with a pocket on the front. I could see through the sheer fabric that just about everyone had rupees in their pockets. So now I knew three things: 1. Based on their age, many of these folks needed glasses. That’s simple biology. 2. Many of them weren’t wearing or carrying glasses, so they probably didn’t own a pair. 3. And most of the people milling around had some money in their pocket. While the glasses might be expensive for someone who only made three dollars a day, each person had access to cash. One by one, as the villagers came up to our table, we handed each of them a laminated sheet with an eye test on it. The test was set up so that it even worked for people who didn’t know how to read, regardless of which languages they spoke. Then, the villager with the laminated sheet was offered a pair of sample glasses and took the test again. Right there, instantly, he or she could see perfectly. That’s how glasses work. It wasn’t a new technology for these men and women, or an untrusted one. After that, the sample glasses were removed and set aside, and the customer was given a mirror and offered a choice of ten different styles. Each was brand new, wrapped in little plastic sleeves. About a third of the people who had come to the table and needed glasses actually bought a pair. A third. This mystified me. I was stunned that 65 percent of the people who needed glasses, who knew they needed glasses, and had money to buy glasses would just walk way. Putting myself in their shoes, I couldn’t imagine making this choice. The supply of glasses was going to disappear in an hour. The price was amazing. The trusted technology worked. What were we doing wrong? I sat in the sun for an hour, thinking hard about this problem. I felt like all my work as a marketer had led me to this moment. So I changed just one thing about the process. One thing that doubled the percentage of glasses sold. Here’s what I did: I took all the glasses off the table. For the rest of the people in line, after they put on the sample glasses, we said, “Here are your new glasses. If they work and you like them, please pay us three dollars. If you don’t want them, please give them back.” That’s it. We changed the story from “Here’s an opportunity to shop, to look good, to regain your sight, to enjoy the process, to feel ownership from beginning to end” to “Do you want us to take away what you have, or do you want to pay to keep the glasses that are already working for you?” Desire for gain versus avoidance of loss. If you’ve been living in abject poverty, it’s hard to imagine the pleasure that more fortunate people take in shopping. To feel the thrill of buying something never bought before. To go shopping is to take a risk. We risk time and money looking for a new thing, a thing that might be great. And we’re able to take that risk because being wrong isn’t fatal. Being wrong doesn’t cost dinner or a medical checkup. And if we’re wrong, not only will we live another day, but we’ll get right back to shopping tomorrow. On the other hand, with the realization that maybe others didn’t think about shopping the way I did, or the way Western opticians did, I saw things differently. Maybe the people we were trying to serve saw shopping for something new as a threat, not as a fun activity. Most teenagers at the typical suburban mall would bristle at the idea that they didn’t get to try on all the glasses, that they didn’t get a choice in the matter. Most of us wouldn’t want a pair of used glasses; we’d want the fancy new ones. Even if “used” simply meant tried on once before. But it’s not helpful to imagine that everyone knows what you know, wants what you want, believes what you believe. My narrative about how to buy glasses isn’t better or worse than the one the next villager in line had. My narrative is simply my narrative, and if it’s not working, it’s arrogant to insist on it. The way we make things better is by caring enough about those we serve to imagine the story that they need to hear. We need to be generous enough to share that story, so they can take action that they’ll be proud of.

## 🧠 Summary
- VisionSpring sells affordable reading glasses to people who need them but traditionally haven't had access.
- Problem: Although people needed glasses, could afford them, and saw immediate benefits, **only 1/3** were buying.
- Insight: Traditional "shopping" behavior didn't apply. Customers feared loss more than they desired gain.
- Change: Instead of asking customers to choose and buy, VisionSpring **put the glasses directly in their hands** and framed it as **"keep it or give it back"** — triggering loss aversion.
- Result: Sales **doubled** instantly.

## 💡 Key Insights
- **Narratives differ**: Your customer’s mindset may not match your own.
- **Loss aversion > Gain seeking**: People fear losing what they have more than they are motivated by gaining something new.
- **Buying is emotional, not logical**: Even when something is clearly helpful, people don't always act rationally.
- **Lower friction to decision**: Make the desired action the easiest, most obvious next step.
- **Respect the customer's worldview**: Don't impose your way of thinking — meet them where they are.

## 🎨 Applications to Poster Business
- **Narrative Matters**: Customers aren't buying "just a poster." They're buying **vibe, identity, pride, belonging**.
- **Loss Framing**: Instead of "Buy this poster!", frame as "Don't miss out — limited edition, once it's gone, it's gone."
- **Reduce Shopping Stress**: Offer a "pre-selected vibe" — instead of showing 100 options, guide them: "If you like X, you’ll LOVE this."
- **Instant Gratification**: Show them how good the poster will immediately look in their space (mockups, AR previews, etc).
- **Trust and Simplicity**: Make checkout fast and frictionless; avoid too many choices or complicated decisions.
- **Understand Emotional Triggers**: Posters aren't *needs* — they are **wants** driven by emotion (coolness, nostalgia, style).
