You’re not a cigar-smoking fat cat You don’t work for a soap company. You’re not an obsolete industrial marketer. So why are you acting like one? Your Kickstarter is nearing its deadline, so sure, you have a good excuse to spam every “influencer” you know, begging for a link. But they ignore you. You work for a content marketing company, and you obsessively track how many clicks your articles get, even though the crap you write embarrasses you. You make graphs of how many Instagram followers you have, even though you know everyone else simply buys followers. you know everyone else simply buys followers. You lower your price because people tell you your rates are too high, but it doesn’t seem to help. It’s all the same old thing—the industrialized selfish same-old, made modern for a new generation. Your emergency is not a license to steal my attention. Your insecurity is not a permit to hustle me or my friends. There’s a more effective way. You can do it. It’s not easy, but the steps are well lit.

## 💡 Key Insights  
- 🚫 **Old habits in new clothes**: Modern marketers often imitate the worst parts of industrial-era marketing (spam, hype, desperate discounting).
- 🧃 **Vanity metrics are hollow**: Followers, likes, and clicks mean nothing if your content lacks authenticity and purpose.
- 🎣 **Desperation is not strategy**: Hustling out of insecurity leads to poor decisions, not growth.
- 🤝 **Permission > Interruption**: Respect people’s attention — don’t steal it. Create something they *want* to engage with.
- 🌱 **There is a better way**: A more honest, generous, long-term strategy exists — it just takes patience and consistency.

## ✅ Checklist: Apply This to Your Poster Business

### 🎯 Focus on Value, Not Vanity
- [x] Stop worrying about likes or follower counts — focus on *comments, saves*, and *shares* (real engagement).
- [x] Don’t obsess over what “others” are doing — buying followers or fake growth won’t build community.

### 💡 Don’t Spam, Build Respect
- [x] Don’t cold DM influencers with “Hey bro promote this” — instead, *build relationships* first by engaging genuinely with their content.
- [ ] Offer something of value (free poster, custom shoutout, collab idea) *before* asking for help.

### 🏷️ Price With Confidence
- [ ] Don’t slash prices just because someone said you're too expensive — back your product with *quality storytelling* and *proof of value*.
- [ ] Highlight what makes your posters unique (limited editions, vibrant style, storytelling) rather than competing on price.

### 🧭 Be the Opposite of Pushy
- [ ] Use *pull marketing* — create compelling reels, BTS stories, and shareable content that draws people in instead of shouting at them.
- [ ] Create a vibe so good that people *want* to tag friends, not because they’re asked to, but because they *feel it*.

### 📈 Embrace the Harder, Better Way
- [x] Stick to your creative vision — even if growth is slow, it’ll be real and sustainable.
- [x] Build systems: plan content weeks ahead, track what works, and consistently improve instead of chasing trends in panic.

> You’re building art and culture, not noise. Don’t act like a soap salesman — be a storyteller, a vibe-setter, a movement.
