# ðŸ§  Seth Godin on Real Marketing â€“ 1983 Reflection

## ðŸ“” Book
```book
In 1983, I was a very young and inexperienced brand manager at Spinnaker, the startup software company I joined after business school. Suddenly, I had millions of dollars in my budget, fancy lunches with ad reps that I didnâ€™t ask for, and an urgent need: to get the word out about the software my amazing team had created. I wasted all that ad money. The ads didnâ€™t work because the ads were ignored. Somehow, though, the software sold. Over the years, Iâ€™ve launched dozens and dozens of projects and sold goods and services to businesses and individuals. Iâ€™ve worked with Jay Levinson, the father of Guerrilla Marketing, with Lester Wunderman, the godfather of direct mail, and Bernadette Jiwa, the doyenne of storytelling. My ideas have built billion-dollar companies and raised nearly that much for important charities. Mostly, the journey has involved noticing what works and trying to understand what doesnâ€™t. Itâ€™s been an ongoing experiment of trial and error (mostly error) with projects and organizations I care about. And now I have a compass for what marketing is today, about the human condition, and about our culture. This approach is simple, but itâ€™s not easy to embrace, because it involves patience, empathy, and respect. The marketing that has suffused our entire lives is not the marketing that you want to do. The shortcuts using money to buy attention to sell average stuff to average people are an artifact of another time, not the one we live in now. You can learn to see how human beings dream, decide, and act. And if you help them become better versions of themselves, the ones they seek to be, youâ€™re a marketer.

## ðŸ“Œ Summary
In 1983, Seth Godin, a young brand manager at Spinnaker, had a big budget and a mission to promote software. Despite investing heavily in advertising, the ads were ignored â€” yet the product still sold. This pivotal experience taught him that marketing isn't about spending money to capture attention, but about creating genuine value that resonates. Over the years, through working with masters like Jay Levinson and Bernadette Jiwa, Godin realized that great marketing is built on **empathy, patience, and respect**, not tricks or noise.

## ðŸŽ¨ Applications to Poster Business
- **Design for transformation, not just decoration**  
  â†’ Create posters that inspire, affirm, or challenge â€” not just fill space.

- **Tell a story with every visual**  
  â†’ Add emotional or thought-provoking context: a quote, a visual metaphor, or a cultural moment.

- **Skip gimmicks, focus on connection**  
  â†’ Build a brand around *trust*, *authentic voice*, and *personal relevance*.

- **Lean into empathy and truth**  
  â†’ Make posters that say what people feel but struggle to express. Be the voice for their inner monologue.

- **Donâ€™t chase trends, build identity**  
  â†’ Let your posters be a movement, not merchandise.
