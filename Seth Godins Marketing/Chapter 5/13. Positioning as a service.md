# 🧭 Positioning as a Service - notes

## 📝 Summary
In an overwhelming world of choices, people often choose *not* to choose. Positioning isn't just about claiming space in the market; it's about deeply understanding the people you want to serve and building something *just for them*. Using an XY positioning grid, marketers can identify underserved corners of the market by picking two extremes people care about. Then, they build truthful, generous offerings that consistently meet the expectations tied to those extremes.

## 💡 Key Insights
- People shut down when choices feel unsafe or overwhelming.
- Positioning is not about being everything for everyone—it's about standing for *something specific*.
- The XY grid helps visualize the market landscape and find a unique position.
- Axes should reflect what people *actually care about*, often emotional rather than just feature-based.
- Consistency and truth in your claims build long-term credibility.
- Competing by differentiation creates clarity, not conflict.
- Serve with generosity—positioning should be a *service*, not just a strategy.

## 🧩 Applications to Any Business
- **Use the XY Grid**: Map your market using axes like Price vs. Purity, or Speed vs. Security.
- **Identify a Gap**: Find underserved customer segments and build directly for them.
- **Position with Purpose**: Choose values that are authentic and meaningful to both you and your audience.
- **Double Down**: Be consistent with the position in your marketing, product, and customer service.
- **Avoid Vagueness**: “We’re for everyone” is a positioning death trap.
- **Choose Edges Over Middle**: Extremes attract attention and loyalty.

## 🎨 Applications to Graphic Design/Posters Business
- **Define Your Axes**: Example – 🎯 Edginess vs. 📈 Trendiness or 🎨 Artistic Integrity vs. 🎁 Commercial Appeal.
- **Map the Poster Market**: Place your designs in contrast to mass-market wall art, memes, high-end art prints, etc.
- **Find Your Niche**: Maybe you’re the bold pop-art designer who mixes nostalgia with social commentary.
- **Be Loud and Clear**: Your style and message should reflect your brand's chosen spot on the grid.
- **Design for Emotion**: Don’t just show; evoke—positioning is about what people *feel* when they see your work.
- **Consistency Across Media**: Make sure your Instagram bio, feed, captions, and shop reflect your unique position.
