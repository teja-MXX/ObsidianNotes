# 💻 Host Artifacts (Yellow Zone) – Pyramid of Pain

## 🟨 Yellow Indicator
- This level represents a **notable pain point for attackers**.
- If defenders can detect host artifacts:
  - Attackers must **change tools or techniques**.
  - Involves **time-consuming** and **resource-heavy** adjustments.
  - **Delays the attack** and increases the chance of detection.

---

## 🧩 What Are Host Artifacts?

Host artifacts are **unique traces or observables** left behind on a compromised system.

### 📌 Examples Include:
- 🧱 Registry values (e.g., Windows Registry modifications)
- ⚙️ Suspicious process executions (e.g., PowerShell spawning cmd)
- 🔍 Known attack patterns or **IOCs** (Indicators of Compromise)
- 🧬 Files dropped by malicious software (e.g., malware executables)
- 🧠 Anything **exclusive to the threat actor's tools or behavior**

---

## 🕵️‍♂️ Why Are Host Artifacts Valuable?

- They provide a **deeper level of detection** than IPs or domains.
- Can help **identify specific tools or malware families**.
- Often signal **lateral movement**, **persistence**, or **privilege escalation**.

---

## 🛠️ Tools to Detect Host Artifacts
- Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) tools
- Host-based Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS)
- Memory and disk forensic tools (e.g., Volatility, FTK Imager)
- SIEM integrations that correlate logs with host behaviors

---

## 💡 Defender Tip
- Track **patterns** and **context**, not just one-off events.
- Focus on behaviors that **persist across multiple systems or sessions**.
- Use threat intelligence feeds to stay updated on emerging IOCs.
