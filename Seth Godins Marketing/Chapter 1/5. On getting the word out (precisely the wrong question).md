## 📌 Summary

- We often obsess over *“How do I get the word out?”* — chasing SEO tricks, Facebook ads, PR features, and flashy advertising. But Seth Godin says that’s backward.
- Real marketing isn’t about *pushing your message out*. That’s the **last step**, not the first.
- Marketing starts with **making something worth talking about**. Something that solves a real problem, touches real people, and is built with intention and service. If that’s done well, the “word” gets out on its own.

## 🔑 Key Insights

- **“Getting the word out” is the end, not the beginning**
  - Focus on *what* you’re saying and *who* you’re serving — not how loud you say it.

- **Old-school tactics don’t work anymore**
  - SEO hacks, interruptive ads, and PR stunts are no longer enough.
  - People tune out “being sold to.” They want to be *seen* and *served*.

- **Marketing = Building something worth discovering**
  - The real question: *“Who am I building this for, and why would they care?”*

- **Marketing is too important to treat like a shortcut**
  - It’s not about virality or visibility alone. It’s about **resonance**.

## 🖼️ How to Apply This to Your Poster Business

### ✅ Shift Your Focus
- [x] Stop asking “How can I get more followers?” or “How can I go viral?”
- [x] Start asking: “Who is this poster for?” and “What change am I trying to make?”

### ✅ Design Posters People *Want* to Share
- [x] Make each poster *worth discovering* — not just visually cool, but emotionally or culturally relevant.
- [ ] E.g., instead of “Breaking Bad Poster,” make it: *“For everyone who rooted for the villain and felt guilty later.”*

### ✅ Build First, Amplify Later
- [x] Focus on crafting high-value, unique content that speaks to your niche.
- [ ] Once the foundation is strong (your art + your messaging), then amplify it via reels, collabs, and hashtags.

### ✅ Avoid the “Hack” Mentality
- [x] Don’t chase SEO hacks or ad tricks right away.
- [x] Build real stories, a real vibe, a real community — and let discovery come from that.

> 📌 Getting the word out doesn’t work unless the *thing* is worth spreading. Create something real, and the right people will not only find it — they’ll *spread it* for you.
