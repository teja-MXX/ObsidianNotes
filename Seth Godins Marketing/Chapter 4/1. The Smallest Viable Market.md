# The Smallest Viable Market
## 📔 Book
>It’s a simple question, but a loaded one, because it implies that you’re
>responsible. You are an actor with intent, an agent of change, a human being
>working hard to change other human beings.
>It might be your job, it might be your passion, and if you’re lucky, it might
>even be both.
>The change might be trivial (“I’m trying to make the market share of OZO
>brand laundry soap go up 1 percent, and to do that, I need to change some
>Clorox users to OZO users”) or it might be profound (“I’m trying to help the
>twelve kids in my after-school program realize that they have more potential and
>skill than the world tells them that they do”).
>Perhaps it’s “I’m going to turn nonvoters into voters,” or “I’m going to
>transform people who seek to dominate into ones who desire affiliation instead.”
>Regardless of what the specifics are, if you’re a marketer, you’re in the
>business of making change happen. Denying this is a form of hiding; it’s more
>productive to own it instead.
>
>Stumble 1: It’s tempting to pick a grandiose, nearly impossible change: “I
>want to change the face of music education and make it a top priority across the
>country.” Well, sure, that’s great, but it’s never been done before, not by
>someone with your resources. I’m a huge fan of game-changing home runs. I
>love the inspiring stories of people who beat all the odds and changed
>everything.
>But . . .
>That’s a heavy burden, as well as a convenient excuse in moments of despair.
>It’s no wonder that you’re stuck—you’re seeking to do the impossible.
>Perhaps it makes more sense to begin with a hurdle you can leap. Perhaps it
>makes sense to be very specific about the change you seek to make, and to make
>it happen. Then, based on that success, you can replicate the process on ever bigger challenges.
>
>Stumble 2: You want to defend what you’re already doing, which is selling
>what you’ve already been charged with selling. So you reverse-engineer a
>“change” that matches that thing, and you load it up with buzzwords that mean
>nothing to anyone. Here’s one I just found: “Activation and engagement for
>TNT’s new thriller that makes a meta-statement about viewer identity.”
>Really?
>On the other hand, here’s an example from By the Way Bakery, which my
>wife founded. It’s the largest gluten-free bakery of its kind in the world. Their
>change? “We want to make sure no one is left out. By offering people glutenfree, dairy-free, and kosher baked goods that happen to be delicious, we let the
>entire community be part of special family occasions. We change hosts from
>exclusive to inclusive, and guests from outsiders to insiders.”

## 🎯 Summary of the Original Excerpt

Seth Godin emphasizes that marketers are fundamentally agents of change. Whether the goal is small or profound, the act of marketing is about making people see, feel, or behave differently. He warns against setting unreasonably grand goals that lead to stagnation, and also cautions against reverse-engineering vague, buzzword-heavy missions just to justify what you’re already doing. Instead, the real power lies in identifying a specific, achievable change and consistently acting on it with clarity and purpose.

## 💡 Key Insights

- **Marketing = Intentional Change**: Your work should result in a tangible shift in people’s behavior or perception.
- **Avoid Grandiosity as a Coping Mechanism**: Lofty goals can become excuses for inaction or failure.
- **Start Small, Scale Later**: Begin with a realistic change, build momentum, and then tackle bigger goals.
- **Clarity Over Buzzwords**: Abstract, corporate-sounding “change” statements are empty without real substance.
- **True Marketing is Inclusive**: Successful change often brings more people into the fold — it’s not about exclusion, it’s about making people feel seen and involved.

## 🖼️ Applications to Poster Business / Graphic Designing

- **Design to Change Minds**: Every poster or design you make should aim to evoke a reaction — humor, nostalgia, rebellion, pride, etc. You're not just selling prints, you're shifting how someone feels when they see it.
- **Avoid Vague Missions**: “Making cool art” isn’t enough. Try “Making people laugh with ironic pop culture posters” or “Helping fans own a piece of cult cinema in vibrant colors.”
- **Start With One Strong Idea**: Don’t wait for a massive brand campaign — launch a single poster that changes how a niche audience feels, and scale from there.
- **Build a Movement, Not Just a Product**: Use your art to bring people together — shared humor, fandom, nostalgia, or values.
