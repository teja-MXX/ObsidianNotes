# Service - Notes

>Marketing acts (interesting choice of word, acts) are the generous actions of people who care. James Brown and the therapist understand that authenticity in the marketplace is a myth, that what people want is to be understood and to be served, not merely to witness whatever you feel like doing in a given moment. And when we do the best version of our best work, our responsibility isn’t to make it for ourselves . . . it’s to bring it to the person we seek to serve. We reserve our best version of the work for them, not for us. Just as a three-star chef doesn’t cook herself a twelve-course meal for dinner, you are not expected (or welcome) to bring us every one of your insecurities, innermost fears, and urgent demands. You’re here to serve.

## 📌 **Summary:**

Marketing is not an act of self-expression—it is an **act of service**. The role of the marketer is to understand, empathize, and generously deliver value to the audience—not to expose personal struggles or random inner thoughts. Like a professional chef cooking for customers, not for themselves, marketers reserve their best work for those they serve, not for their own satisfaction.

    Your role is similar to an actor, chef, or therapist—you play the role your audience needs.

    You are **responsible for delivering your best** to the market, not for satisfying your private desires or creative whims.
4. **Generosity is Key:**  
    Success comes from generously serving customers by anticipating what they need, want, or dream of.
5. **Emotional Labor is Part of the Job:**  
    Serving your audience often requires controlled emotion, thoughtfulness, and preparation—not unfiltered personal exposure.

## 👕 **Applications to Shirts Apparel Business:**

1. **Create Designs that Speak to Customer Identity:**  
    Shirts should represent the wearer’s attitude, humor, or beliefs—not only the designer's personal opinions.

    Frame shirt designs around **what the customer will feel wearing it**, not around your personal story.
3. **Professional, Consistent Engagement:**  
    Respond to customers in comments/DMs politely, generously, and **with their perspective in mind**.
4. **Market the Lifestyle, Not the Designer:**  
    Customers buy what represents **their style and mood**—so make posts about **them wearing your designs confidently**, not about your process frustration.

## 📖 **Story: How a Marketer Used This Concept for the Apparel Business**

Ravi, the marketing head for a bold-shirt apparel startup, used to post his team's daily struggles—late nights at the print shop, design delays, packaging mishaps—believing customers would feel "connected" by knowing the chaos.
But the followers didn’t care. They wanted confidence, attitude, and style—not tired designer stories.
After learning this concept of **service over self-expression**, Ravi shifted gears. Every post now said: **“This shirt is your silent rebellion”** or “For the bold ones who walk into a room and own it.”
He created Instagram Reels showing customers wearing the shirts at cafes, colleges, and gigs—not the messy print room.
Sales rose. DMs increased. People said: "This feels like me."
Ravi learned—**marketing is not about revealing you, it’s about serving them.**
