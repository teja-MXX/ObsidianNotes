# 💠 The Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis

## 🧠 Overview

- Developed in **2013** by Sergio Caltagirone, Andrew Pendergast, and Christopher Betz.
- Designed to represent the **core components of an intrusion** and their relationships.
- Named the **"Diamond Model"** because the four features form the shape of a diamond, connected by their relationships.

## 🔹 Core Features

Each intrusion event is represented by four key **nodes**:

1. **Adversary**  
   - The threat actor or group responsible for the intrusion.
   - Includes motive, tools used, behavior, and identifiers.

2. **Infrastructure**  
   - The systems and services used to launch or support the attack.
   - Examples: C2 servers, compromised websites, proxy chains.

3. **Capability**  
   - The tools or malware used in the attack.
   - Includes exploits, RATs, zero-days, ransomware, etc.

4. **Victim**  
   - The targeted organization, system, or individual.
   - May include specific users, departments, or industries.

## ➕ Additional Axes

These **meta-features** provide deeper context:

- **Social–Political**  
  (Motivation, objectives, organizational behavior)

- **Technology**  
  (Details of vulnerabilities exploited, platforms targeted)

## 🎯 Why Use the Diamond Model?

- Helps **analyze and decompose attacks** into atomic elements.
- Aids in **forecasting adversary behavior** and future campaigns.
- Enables **real-time intelligence integration** and event correlation.
- Useful for explaining intrusions to **non-technical stakeholders**.
- Forms a **repeatable framework** for intrusion analysis and response.

## 🛠 Use Cases

- Building incident reports
- Threat hunting and attribution
- Briefing leadership on cybersecurity events
- Mapping APT campaigns and behavior

## 🎭 Diamond Model Core Feature: Adversary

### 🧾 Definition

- An **adversary** (aka attacker, enemy, cyber threat actor, or hacker) is the individual or group behind a cyberattack.
- According to the creators of the Diamond Model:
  > "An adversary is an actor or organization responsible for utilizing a capability against the victim to achieve their intent."

### 🎯 Key Concepts

- **Cyberattacks** can take the form of **intrusions** (unauthorized access) or **breaches** (data exfiltration or compromise).
- **Adversary knowledge is often limited or empty** in early phases of analysis, especially at first discovery.
- Identifying adversaries requires:
  - Incident forensics
  - Malware signatures
  - TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures)
  - Attribution data

### 👥 Adversary Roles

#### 🔹 Adversary Operator
- The individual or group **conducting the intrusion activity**.
- Also called the "hacker" or technical actor.
- May use different tools and infrastructures per campaign.

#### 🔹 Adversary Customer
- The person or organization that **benefits from the intrusion**.
- May or may not be the same as the operator.
- Can control multiple operators and campaigns.
- Helps define:
  - **Intent** (e.g. espionage, financial gain)
  - **Attribution**
  - **Adaptability & Persistence**

### 🧠 Example

> A nation-state adversary customer might sponsor multiple operators, each targeting different sectors with unique capabilities and infrastructure.

## 🧍 Diamond Model Core Feature: Victim

### 🧾 Definition

- A **victim** is the **target of an adversary's intrusion or attack**.
- Victims can include:
  - Organizations
  - Individuals
  - IP addresses
  - Email accounts
  - Networks
  - Domains

### 🔍 Analytical Importance

- Every cyberattack **involves a victim** — the adversary's operations are always directed toward someone or something.
- Understanding the victim helps reveal:
  - Attack motivation
  - Initial access vector
  - Potential impacts
  
### 🎯 Example

> A **spear-phishing email** is sent to a specific employee of a company.  
> The **person who receives and clicks the link** is the *victim*.  
> The **organization** is also a victim — especially if the intrusion leads to lateral movement or data theft.



### 🔄 Victim Dimensions

#### 👤 Victim Personae
- Who is being **targeted**:
  - Names of individuals
  - Companies or organizations
  - Job titles or departments (e.g., HR, Finance)
  - Industries (e.g., healthcare, defense)
  - Interests or affiliations

#### 💻 Victim Assets
- What is being **attacked**:
  - Devices
  - Email addresses
  - IP addresses
  - Web domains
  - Network infrastructure
  - Social media profiles

> 🎯 Personae = *Who* is targeted  
> 🛡 Assets = *What* is targeted

# 💠 Story: The Diamond Behind the Breach

It started with a single email.

Riya, a mid-level HR executive at BioNex Labs, received what looked like a job application with an attached résumé. The file opened fine. Nothing seemed odd. But hidden inside the document was a macro that launched a PowerShell script.

The **capability** here was subtle but effective — a custom-built RAT that created a foothold without dropping files, using only memory. It was stealthy, fast, and triggered minimal alerts. Classic living-off-the-land.

The **infrastructure** powering this attack was a rented VPS acting as the command-and-control (C2) server. The attacker routed all traffic through compromised proxies, masking their origin. DNS over HTTPS was used for beaconing. The domain? Registered two weeks ago, spoofing a legitimate recruiting site.

As for the **victim**, BioNex Labs had recently announced a breakthrough in cancer detection. They were an attractive target — valuable intellectual property and under-resourced cybersecurity. Riya’s system was only the entry point. The attackers quickly pivoted to the internal research subnet.

The **adversary**? Based on toolmarks, TTPs, and external threat intel, it pointed toward a known APT group with a history of targeting biotech firms. Their motivation was likely **espionage** — not destruction, but quiet theft.

The SOC team, during IR, applied the Diamond Model to structure the incident report. They mapped out relationships between the victim, infrastructure, adversary, and capabilities. This helped them track how the adversary moved, when, and using what tools.

They marked the **timestamp** of the initial beacon as `2025-07-10 03:12:55 UTC`. The **phase** was classified as **Exploitation**, progressing to **Command and Control**. The **result**? Initially, *Success – Confidentiality Compromised*. But before exfiltration could begin, they detected the DNS beaconing and isolated the system.

Understanding the **intent** helped leadership prioritize action. This wasn’t ransomware or financial fraud — this was about intellectual theft. The adversary’s needs were tied to long-term strategy, not quick cash.

By using the Diamond Model, BioNex’s team didn’t just clean up the incident. They built a repeatable framework to anticipate how the next one might unfold — with similar actors, new tools, and slightly altered infrastructure.
