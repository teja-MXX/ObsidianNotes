> _People are waiting for you _
> 
> They just don’t know it yet. They’re waiting for the edge you will stake out, the one that they can imagine but don’t expect. They’re waiting for the connection you will offer. The ability to see and be seen. And they’re waiting for the tension of the possible, the ability to make things better.
