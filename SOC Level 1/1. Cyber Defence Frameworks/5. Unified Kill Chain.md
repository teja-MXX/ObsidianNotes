# 🔗 What is a Kill Chain in Cybersecurity?

## 📜 Origin of the Term "Kill Chain"
- Originally a **military concept**, a **Kill Chain** refers to the structure of an attack — identifying, targeting, engaging, and destroying the enemy.
- In **cybersecurity**, this concept was adapted to describe the **stages of a cyber attack**.

## 🧠 Cyber Kill Chain: Definition & Purpose

### ✅ Definition
A **Cyber Kill Chain** is a framework that breaks down the **methodology/path** attackers (such as hackers or APTs) use to:
- Approach,
- Intrude, and
- Exploit a target.

For instance:
> An attacker scanning for vulnerabilities, exploiting a web flaw, and escalating privileges — this sequence forms a **Kill Chain**.

### 🎯 Objective of Understanding the Kill Chain
- **Identify** how attackers operate at each stage.
- **Implement defenses** to stop the attack as early as possible.
- **Disrupt or break** the chain at any point to prevent full compromise.

By studying the **Kill Chain**, security professionals can:
- **Pre-emptively protect systems** by understanding attack paths.
- **Detect early warning signs** of an attack.
- **Interrupt attackers** before they achieve their goals.

## 🛡️ Defensive Strategy
Understanding the attacker’s **Kill Chain** allows organizations to:
- Harden each stage of their defenses.
- Deploy **layered security controls**.
- Respond more effectively during real-world incidents.

## 🕵️ UKC Phase: Reconnaissance (MITRE Tactic TA0043)

### 📌 Description
Reconnaissance is the **initial phase** where an attacker gathers information about a target to inform later phases like weaponisation and exploitation.

### 🧰 Types of Reconnaissance
- **Passive**: Observing without direct interaction (e.g. WHOIS, Google, LinkedIn).
- **Active**: Probing the target directly (e.g. port scanning, DNS queries).

### 🔍 Objectives of Reconnaissance

- 🔧 **Identify Systems & Services**
  - Detect what technologies (e.g., web servers, databases) the target uses.
  - Aids in weapon selection and planning an exploit path.

- 👤 **Harvest Employee Information**
  - Locate employee names, roles, and contact info via OSINT or social media.
  - Sets up phishing and impersonation attacks.

- 🔐 **Search for Credentials**
  - Look for leaked or reused passwords via paste sites or data breaches.
  - Useful for brute force, credential stuffing, or privilege escalation.

- 🌐 **Map Network Topology**
  - Understand connected systems and how to move laterally within the environment.
  - Helps with pivoting and privilege escalation later.

> 🧠 **Insight**: Recon is not a one-time step — information gathered here supports multiple stages throughout the kill chain.

## 💣 UKC Phase: Weaponization (MITRE Tactic TA0001)

### 📌 Description
Weaponization is the phase where the adversary prepares the necessary infrastructure and tools to carry out an attack. This includes developing or customizing payloads, and setting up systems that will later be used to interact with the compromised target.

### 🧰 Key Activities

- 🖥️ **Set Up Command & Control (C2) Server**
  - Create a server to remotely control compromised hosts.
  - May use HTTP(S), DNS, or custom protocols to avoid detection.

- 🐚 **Configure Reverse Shell Listeners**
  - Prepare systems that listen for reverse connections from exploited systems.
  - Critical for gaining interactive access after initial compromise.

- 🧬 **Develop or Customize Payloads**
  - Create malware, shellcode, or phishing documents.
  - Often tailored to the target system's environment (e.g., OS, antivirus evasion).

- 📦 **Package Exploits**
  - Combine exploits with delivery mechanisms like documents, scripts, or installers.
  - Tools like Metasploit or Cobalt Strike may be used to streamline this.

> ⚙️ **Goal**: Be ready to execute the attack and maintain interaction with the target once access is gained.

## 🎭 UKC Phase: Social Engineering (MITRE Tactic TA0001)

### 📌 Description
Social Engineering involves manipulating individuals into performing actions or divulging confidential information that furthers the attacker’s objectives. It leverages psychological manipulation rather than purely technical methods.

### 🧠 Common Techniques

- 📧 **Phishing Attacks**
  - Sending emails with malicious attachments or links.
  - Can include spearphishing (targeted) or bulk phishing.

- 🌐 **Credential Harvesting**
  - Impersonating legitimate websites to trick users into entering credentials.
  - Often used in conjunction with phishing emails or fake login portals.

- 📞 **Phone-Based Impersonation**
  - Calling employees and pretending to be IT support or another trusted entity.
  - Goal: extract sensitive data, reset passwords, or gain remote access.

- 🛠️ **Physical Impersonation**
  - Visiting the site in person and posing as:
    - Utility workers
    - Delivery personnel
    - Maintenance staff
  - Goal: gain unauthorized physical access or plug in malicious devices.

> 🎯 **Goal**: Trick users into compromising security voluntarily or unknowingly to assist in the attack chain.

## 💥 UKC Phase: Exploitation (MITRE Tactic TA0002)

### 📌 Description
This phase describes how an attacker leverages weaknesses or vulnerabilities in a system to execute malicious code. Exploitation often follows successful delivery or social engineering and is critical for establishing an initial foothold.

### 🛠️ Common Exploitation Techniques

- 🐚 **Reverse Shell Execution**
  - Uploading a reverse shell via a vulnerable web app and executing it.
  - Opens a connection back to the attacker's system.

- 🌀 **Script Interference**
  - Manipulating trusted or automated scripts (e.g., cron jobs, startup scripts) to execute attacker-controlled code.

- 🌐 **Web Application Vulnerabilities**
  - Exploiting flaws like:
    - Remote Code Execution (RCE)
    - Command Injection
    - Local File Inclusion (LFI)
  - Allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the server.

> 🎯 **Goal**: Achieve code execution on the target system by abusing application, system, or configuration vulnerabilities.

---
## 🔐 UKC Phase: Persistence (MITRE Tactic TA0003)

### 📌 Description
This phase covers the techniques adversaries use to **maintain long-term access** to a compromised system. Persistence ensures that access is **retained across reboots, disconnections, or account changes**, allowing continued control.

### 🛠️ Common Persistence Techniques

- 🔁 **Creating a Malicious Service**
  - Installing a service that restarts on boot or runs periodically to reconnect to the attacker.

- 🌐 **Command & Control (C2) Registration**
  - Linking the compromised system to a C2 server so it can receive and execute remote commands persistently.

- 🎭 **Conditional Backdoors**
  - Placing backdoors that only activate under certain conditions:
    - e.g., reverse shell launches when an administrator logs in.

> 🎯 **Goal**: Ensure continued, stealthy access even if the attacker’s initial connection is lost or detected.

---
## 🛡️ UKC Phase: Defence Evasion (MITRE Tactic TA0005)

### 📌 Description
This phase outlines the methods adversaries use to **bypass or disable security controls** and detection mechanisms. It plays a crucial role in **remaining undetected** during an attack.

### 🛠️ Common Defence Evasion Techniques

- 🔥 **Bypassing Web Application or Network Firewalls**
  - Obfuscating payloads or tunneling traffic through allowed protocols (e.g., HTTPS, DNS).

- 🧼 **Disabling Anti-virus or EDR**
  - Modifying or killing security processes.
  - Deploying payloads that avoid signature-based detection.

- 👻 **Evading Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**
  - Using low-and-slow attack techniques.
  - Encrypting or encoding traffic to avoid pattern recognition.

> 🎯 **Goal**: Avoid detection and prolong access, making forensic analysis and real-time threat detection harder.
