# The Myth of Rational Choice — Seth Godin Notes

## 📘 Original Excerpt  
> The myth of rational choice  
> Microeconomics is based on a demonstrably false assertion: “The rational agent is assumed to take account of available information, probabilities of events, and potential costs and benefits in determining preferences, and to act consistently in choosing the self-determined best choice of action,” says Wikipedia.  
> Of course not.  
> Perhaps if we average up a large enough group of people, it’s possible that in some ways, on average, we might see glimmers of this behavior. But it’s not something I’d want you to bet on.  
> In fact, the bet you’d be better off making is: “When in doubt, assume that people will act according to their current irrational urges, ignoring information that runs counter to their beliefs, trading long-term for short-term benefits and most of all, being influenced by the culture they identify with.”  
> You can make two mistakes here:  
> 1. Assume that the people you’re seeking to serve are well-informed, rational, independent, long-term choice makers.  
> 2. Assume that everyone is like you, knows what you know, wants what you want.  
> I’m not rational and neither are you.

## 🧠 Summary  
People don’t make rational choices — they’re driven by impulse, short-term rewards, and cultural influence. Believing your audience behaves logically or exactly like you is a marketing mistake.

## 🎨 Application to Poster Business  
- Don’t sell logic (“high-quality, affordable posters”) — sell **impulse, status, and identity**.  
- Focus your poster campaigns on **immediate emotional impact** (funny, badass, nostalgic).  
- Create a vibe or lifestyle your audience **wants to identify with** (e.g., retro rebel, pop art fan, film geek).  
- Assume most people won’t read detailed descriptions — your **visual, caption, and first impression** must hit fast and hard.  
- Your best customers might not be “art lovers” but rather people looking for identity, coolness, or a vibe for their room or reel.

  - “This poster belongs in your room.”  
  - “Warning: This poster may cause jealousy.”  
  - “Your wall called — it wants this.”
