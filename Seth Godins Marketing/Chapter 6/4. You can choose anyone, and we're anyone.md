Imagine a shoeshine stand downtown. One approach is to find the best location you can afford and offer to shine the shoes of anyone who needs a shoeshine. There are problems with this. First, if anyone can shine shoes the way you shine shoes, then a competitor down the street will take half of your business—more, if they cut their price. Second, and more important, no one needs their shoes shined. It’s a want, not a need. And why should anyone bother? Perhaps that customer wants to look good, look like his dad looked, or like Michael Jackson looked; it makes him feel good. More confident. More likely to contribute and feel empowered. Perhaps it’s for someone who likes the status of having someone wait on him. Once a week, he gets to sit in a throne, with a well-dressed, respectful craftsperson putting effort into his appearance. Perhaps it’s a signifier. That he wouldn’t bother with this except it’s what people like him are supposed to do. And not any shoeshine. This shoeshine, in this public spot, from this respected craftsperson. Any of these edges and stories and transformations are available to the craftsperson as soon as he decides to make a difference. Knowing that this is the story your customer tells himself is insufficient. You still have to act on it, open the door to the possibility, and organize the entire experience around that story. This is the work that helps people understand that you are special, and this is the work that makes things better.

## 📌 Summary
Trying to serve everyone means you're just "anyone." The danger of being generic is invisibility in a world overflowing with choices. People don’t buy what you sell — they buy how it makes them feel, what it says about them, and what story it lets them tell themselves. Great marketers don’t sell services; they sell transformations and identities.

## 💡 Key Insights
- Serving “anyone” = being “no one.”
- **Needs vs Wants**: Most products (like a shoeshine) are wants, not needs. People must *want to want* them.
- People buy for **emotional and identity reasons**, not utility.
- Great products become *rituals, symbols, or status signifiers*.
- **Your job is to know and act on the customer’s story** — organize your entire experience around it.
---
## 🧠 Actionable Reflections
- What is the story your ideal customer is telling themselves?
- How can your offer be *the final piece* that completes that story?
- Do your visuals, messaging, and presence **elevate the buyer**?

---
## 🧠 Applications to Any Business
- Don’t be a generic service provider — stand for something.
- Instead of shouting “We’re here for anyone,” say “We’re *exactly* for you.”
- Ask: What does my customer believe about themselves? How can I help them become more of that?
- Build experiences and branding around emotional triggers — pride, belonging, confidence, nostalgia.
- Don't focus only on "what" you do — focus on *why* it matters to them.

## 🎨 Applications to Poster Business
- Don’t design posters for everyone — design for people with a *specific taste, attitude, or obsession*.
- Create collections based on **identity tribes**, e.g., “Posters for the Misfits”, “Wall Art for Anti-Nine-to-Fivers”.
- Use product copy to describe how it feels to *own that poster*, not just what it is.
- Reels idea: “This isn’t just a poster — it’s a mirror for people who…”

## 👕 Apparel Business (Shirts, not T-shirts) — To-Do Checklist
- [ ] Choose a **niche customer**: not “shirt buyers” but maybe “rebellious office goers” or “quiet creatives who hate fashion trends”.
- [ ] Design a shirt not around style, but around **meaning**: e.g., a clean white shirt with an inner collar quote like “Not just another 9-5”.
- [ ] Curate the **story around the experience**: packaging, tone of site, visuals — everything must tell the *same* story.
- [ ] Use subtle, personal design elements (like **secret messages** in stitching or cuffs) to create *ritualistic value*.
- [ ] Make a reel or photo post: “This shirt is for you if you ____” (fill in identity traits).
- [ ] Focus on **transformation language** in marketing: “This isn’t just a shirt — it’s a mindset.”
- [ ] Ask customers: “What does wearing this make you feel?” — collect and reuse as testimonials.
