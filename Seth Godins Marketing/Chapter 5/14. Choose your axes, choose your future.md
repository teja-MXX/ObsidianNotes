# Choose your axes - Notes

> _Choose your axes, choose your future_

> When you look at the list of available attributes, it‚Äôs tempting to pick the ones that most people care about. After all, it‚Äôs hard work to claim an edge, and to pick one that few people care about seems foolish. Better, we think, to pick the popular one. If you do, you‚Äôll certainly be choosing a crowded quadrant. And without the magic of advertising, it‚Äôs very difficult to grow in a quadrant that‚Äôs crowded. Your customer doesn‚Äôt know what to do, so he does nothing. The alternative is to build your own quadrant. To find two axes that have been overlooked. To build a story, a true story, that keeps your promise, that puts you in a position where you are the clear and obvious choice. Everyone else, the average or hard-working brands that picked the average or popular axes‚Äîthey‚Äôre all lumped together. They are Oldsmobile and Plymouth and Chevrolet and the rest of the lumpenproletariat. You, on the other hand, have gone out on a limb, one that belongs to you, and maybe, just maybe, there are underserved customers out there who can‚Äôt wait to find you, connect with you, and spread the word.
