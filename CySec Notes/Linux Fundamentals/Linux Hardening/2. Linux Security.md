# Linux Security Basics

## 🛡️ Overview

All computer systems are vulnerable to intrusion. Linux systems are generally safer but still require good security practices.


## 📦 Keeping OS and Packages Updated

- **Command**:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt dist-upgrade
```
- Ensures the OS and all installed packages have the latest security patches.

## 🔥 Firewall and iptables

- Use **Linux firewall** (ufw, firewalld) and/or **iptables** to restrict inbound and outbound traffic.
- Good practice: **Default Deny All**, only allow necessary ports.

## 🔑 SSH Hardening

- Disable password-based authentication.
- Disable root login over SSH.
- Always use **key-based authentication**.
- Principle of **least privilege**:
    - Only give users the minimum sudo permissions needed.

## 🚫 Fail2ban

- Monitors failed login attempts.
- Bans IP addresses after a defined number of failed attempts.

## 📋 System Auditing

- Regularly audit the system for vulnerabilities:
    - Outdated kernel
    - Incorrect user permissions
    - World-writable files
    - Misconfigured cron jobs or services
- **Important**: Some kernels require manual updates!

## 🔒 SELinux / AppArmor

- Kernel security modules for **Mandatory Access Control** (MAC).
- **SELinux** Concepts:
    - Every file, directory, and process has a **label**.
    - Policies define what actions are allowed between labeled objects.
    - Example Label: ``` system_u:object_r:etc_t:s0```
    - Provides **granular control** like:
	    - Who can read, write, execute, append, move files, etc.

## 🛠️ Security Tools

- **Snort**: Network intrusion detection
- **chkrootkit**: Checks for rootkits
- **rkhunter**: Rootkit scanner
- **Lynis**: Security auditing tool

## 📚 General Security Best Practices

- Remove or disable unnecessary services/software.
- Remove services relying on unencrypted authentication.
- Enable **NTP** (Network Time Protocol) and **Syslog** logging.
- Each user must have their **own account**.
- Enforce **strong password policies**.
- Set **password aging** and restrict reusing old passwords.
- **Lock user accounts** after multiple failed login attempts.
- Disable **unwanted SUID/SGID binaries**.

## 🧱 TCP Wrappers

- Controls access to services based on client IP or hostname.

**Config Files:**

- `/etc/hosts.allow`
- `/etc/hosts.deny`

**Example `/etc/hosts.allow`**:
```bash
# Allow SSH from internal network
sshd : 10.129.14.0/24

# Allow FTP from a specific host
ftpd : 10.129.14.10
```

**Example `/etc/hosts.deny`**:
```bash
# Deny all from a specific domain
ALL : .inlanefreight.com

# Deny SSH from specific IP
sshd : 10.129.22.22

# Deny FTP from a subnet
ftpd : 10.129.22.0/24
```

⚡ **Important**:

- First matching rule is applied.
- TCP Wrappers **only protect services**, not ports like a firewall.

## 🎯 Conclusion

Security is not a one-time setup. It's a **continuous process**.  
A secure system is the result of **good habits** + **constant auditing** + **staying up-to-date**.
