To trigger even a **split-second emotional response**, a poster must do at least one of the following:

1. **Shock or Surprise** – A twist, irony, or visual you didn’t expect.
2. **Relatability** – Something that feels like, _"This is me."_
3. **Aesthetic Pleasure** – Visually so striking or different it _feels good_ to look at.
4. **Empowerment** – A quote, symbol, or mood that makes you feel stronger or cooler.
5. **Humor or Wit** – A clever line or meme-level idea that hits fast.
6. **Nostalgia** – A style, reference, or color scheme that reminds someone of the past.
7. **Edge or Attitude** – Something bold or rebellious that grabs attention by being _not safe_.
