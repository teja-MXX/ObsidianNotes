# ✅ Market-Driven Poster Business Checklist (When You Have No Followers)

## 🎯 Define your ideal customer:
- [ ]   Write down who your posters are *for* — age group, interests (movies, music, pop culture, art), lifestyle, and values.
## 🧠 List emotional triggers:  
- [ ] Identify what *feelings* your posters should evoke — nostalgia, rebellion, pride, identity, status, etc.

## 🔍 Research your market:
- [ ] Explore Reddit threads, Instagram hashtags, YouTube comments, and Pinterest boards related to your themes.
- [ ] Note what content gets engagement — styles, characters, colors, messages.

## 📦 Create poster samples based on this research:
- [ ] Design 3–5 posters aligned with common emotional desires (e.g., "badass nostalgia," "aesthetic comfort," or "cult fandom").

## 🗣️ Get real feedback:
- [ ] Show your designs to friends, online communities (like subreddits), or WhatsApp groups.
- [ ] Ask: “Which one would you hang on your wall? Why?”

## 🤝 Join 3–5 online communities (Reddit, Discord, Facebook groups):
- [ ]   Participate by sharing value, and **subtly** introducing your work when appropriate.

## 📖 Tell stories with each post:
- [ ] Frame every poster with *why it matters* emotionally, not just what it looks like.

## 📈 Track response manually:
- [ ] Note what people resonate with even in small ways — comments, likes, shares, DMs.

## 🎨 Design for them, not for everyone:
- [ ] Keep evolving your style based on those early reactions — this is your **starting market signal**.
