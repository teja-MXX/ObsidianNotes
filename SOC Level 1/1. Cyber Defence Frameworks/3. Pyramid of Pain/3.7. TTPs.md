# 🔺 TTPs – Tactics, Techniques & Procedures (Red Zone)

## 🔴 Red Indicator – The Apex of the Pyramid of Pain
- TTPs represent **how** adversaries operate — not just **what** they use.
- This includes their **strategies, behaviors, and goals** throughout the attack lifecycle.

## 🧠 What Are TTPs?

**TTPs** = **Tactics + Techniques + Procedures**

| Term        | Description                                                                 |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Tactics** | The **why** – high-level objectives (e.g., Initial Access, Lateral Movement) |
| **Techniques** | The **how** – specific ways to achieve the objective (e.g., Spearphishing) |
| **Procedures** | The **exact steps/tools/scripts** used by attackers                     |

Refer to: **[MITRE ATT&CK Framework](https://attack.mitre.org)** – maps real-world adversary behavior.

## 🎯 Why Is Detecting TTPs So Effective?

If you can detect TTPs:
- ✅ You neutralize attacks **regardless of tool or IP used**
- ✅ Forces attackers to completely **change methodology**
- ✅ Most attackers will **give up and move on**

Example:
> 🔍 Detecting a **Pass-the-Hash attack** via **Windows Event Logs** lets you identify the compromised host and **halt lateral movement** before more damage is done.

## 🛠️ How to Detect TTPs?

- 🔍 **Behavior-based Detection**
- ⚙️ **SIEM Correlation Rules** tied to MITRE ATT&CK
- 🧠 **Threat Hunting Playbooks**
- 🔔 **Sysmon + Windows Event Logs + Audit Policies**
- 📊 Tools like:
  - **Elastic SIEM**
  - **Splunk**
  - **Sigma Rules** (convert to different SIEM formats)

## 🧠 Summary

🎯 **TTPs are attacker behavior.**
- Unlike IPs, hashes, or domains, behaviors are **hard to change**.
- If you can detect these early, attackers are **crippled** or **forced to retreat**.
