# 🔐 The Lock and The Key

## 📔 Book

The lock and the key It doesn’t make any sense to make a key and then run around looking for a lock to open. The only productive solution is to find a lock and then fashion a key. It’s easier to make products and services for the customers you seek to serve than it is to find customers for your products and services.

## 🧠 Summary  
The common marketing mistake is to create something first (the key) and then go hunting for people who might want it (the lock). That’s backwards. True effectiveness lies in understanding what people *already* need, want, or care about — and then creating something that fits exactly into that gap.

Create for your audience — not in hopes of finding one.

## 💡 Key Insights  
- 🛑 Don’t build first, then market — understand the need *before* you create.
- 🧭 The customer you seek to serve should guide the product you build.
- 🔍 The best marketing starts with empathy: what does your audience truly want?
- 🧩 Your work is a “key” — but it must be made *to fit* a real “lock” out there.
- 🎯 Focus first on identifying the *right problem* to solve, not just making cool stuff.

## ✅ Checklist: Apply This to Your Poster Business

### 👂 Understand the "Lock" (What People Want)
- [x] Research trending shows, nostalgia waves, memes, and cultural icons.
- [x] Engage with your audience via polls or Q&As to find what *they* want on their walls.

### 🧑‍🎨 Then Design the "Key" (What You Make)
- [x] Make posters *inspired by real demand* — don’t just create what looks cool to you.
- [x] Validate poster ideas before designing (ask followers, test reactions to mockups).

### 🎣 Start With the Market
- [ ] Instead of wondering “how to sell this design,” ask: “who is already looking for this?”
- [ ] Follow fan pages, forums, Reddit threads — absorb what your ideal customer loves.

### 🛠️ Craft Posters with Precision
- [ ] Use styles and themes that align with your audience’s taste (e.g. minimal, pop, grunge).
- [ ] Every design = a response to a desire. Don’t guess — listen, then create.

### 📌 Position Clearly
- [ ] Make it obvious who each poster is *for* (“This is for anime lovers who also love minimal design”).
- [ ] Design categories around people (e.g., “For Movie Buffs,” “For Sarcastic Roommates,” “For Retro Lovers”).
