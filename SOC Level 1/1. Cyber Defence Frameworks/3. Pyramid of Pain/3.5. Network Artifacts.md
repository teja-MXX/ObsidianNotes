# 🌐 Network Artifacts (Yellow Zone) – Pyramid of Pain

## 🟨 Yellow Indicator
- Network artifacts are **difficult but not impossible** for attackers to change.
- Detecting these can **force attackers to reconfigure** their tools or techniques.
- Gives defenders **more time** to respond, remediate, and anticipate next moves.

## 🌐 What Are Network Artifacts?

Network artifacts are **identifiable traces** of attacker communication or behavior over the network.

### 📌 Common Examples:
- 🧭 **User-Agent Strings**
  - Defined by [RFC2616](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616)
  - May appear **unusual** or **inconsistent** with normal traffic
- 🔗 **Command & Control (C2) Information**
  - IPs, domains, or protocols used to communicate with malware
- 🧪 **URI Patterns**
  - Specific structures in **HTTP POST** or **GET** requests used by attacker tools

---

## 🧰 Tools to Detect Network Artifacts

- 🧠 **Wireshark / TShark**
  - Analyze **PCAP files** to inspect request headers and payloads
- 🛡️ **IDS/IPS systems**
  - Examples: **Snort**, **Suricata**
  - Log network anomalies and attack signatures
- 🔍 **SIEM Tools**
  - Correlate logs with known **network-based IOCs**

---

## 🧠 Why Do Network Artifacts Matter?

- Provide visibility into **attacker infrastructure and behavior**
- Help correlate with host artifacts and establish a **chain of activity**
- Can often be **blocked or redirected** as a defense measure

---

## 🧪 Practical Examples
- A suspicious User-Agent like `Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0) like Gecko`
- POST request to a known malicious URI `/admin/connect.php`
- DNS requests with domains tied to malware campaigns
