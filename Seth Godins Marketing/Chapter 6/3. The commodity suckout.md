>If you make something that others make, if it’s something we can find on Upwork, on Amazon, or Alibaba, you’ve got pain. It’s the pain of knowing that if you raise your price enough to earn a decent return on the effort you’re putting into your work, we’ll just go somewhere else and buy it cheaper. When the price of everything is a click away, we’re not afraid to click. Selling ice cream on the beach in the summer is easy. Raising people’s expectations, engaging in their hopes and dreams, helping them see further— that’s the difficult work we signed up for. From now on, your customers know more than you do about your competitors. And so your commodity work, no matter how much effort you put into it, is not enough.

## 📌 Summary
In a world of frictionless pricing and endless competition, anything that can be made by many is instantly commoditized. When customers can compare and switch with a click, your value can’t come from **what** you make — it has to come from **how** you connect, differentiate, and transform.

- Focus on a **narrative** or **belief system** customers can buy into.
- Shift from transactional to **transformational** value: don’t sell the drill bit — sell the dream.
- Invest in **branding, storytelling**, and **community**, not just features or price points.

## 🎨 Applications to Posters / Graphic Design Business
- Don’t sell just “posters” — sell *culture*, *attitude*, or *aesthetic identity*.
- Create *niche* collections (e.g. “Frustrated Creatives”, “Anti-Hustle Minimalism”, “Pop Icons Who Broke Rules”).
- Your Instagram shouldn’t just display designs — it should evoke **emotions**, **stories**, and **inside jokes** that your niche audience feels.
- **Collaborate with micro-influencers** or **memers** in your niche who can push emotional resonance over visual novelty.

## 👕 To-Do List for Apparel Business (Shirts)
- [ ] **Avoid generic quotes or clipart designs** — instead, print narratives or cultural truths.
- [ ] Focus on shirt collections with themes: “Workplace Rebels”, “Unspoken Truths”, “Brown Parent Mode”.

- [ ] Build micro-campaigns around **one belief per drop** (e.g. “You Don’t Need Permission” or “Outdated Is Overrated”).
- [ ] Your product page should **tell a story**, not just list specs — make each shirt a conversation starter.
- [ ] Add QR codes on tags linking to a reel or manifesto for that shirt.
- [ ] Identify a **pain point or inside joke** of your target audience and print it (that’s your differentiator).
