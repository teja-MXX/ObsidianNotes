# Humility and Curiosity - Notes
## 📔Book
>Humility and curiosity A marketer is curious about other people. She wonders about what others are struggling with, what makes them tick. She’s fascinated by their dreams and their beliefs. And she has the humility to embrace the lack of time and attention that her audience wrestles with every day. People aren’t eager to pay you with their attention. The fact that you bought an ad doesn’t earn you something that priceless. Instead, we can hope that people might voluntarily trade their attention. Trade it for something they need or want. Trade it because they’re genuinely interested. Trade it because they trust you to keep your promise. Not everyone will be interested. But if you do your job right, enough people will. This is the lock and the key. You’re not running around grabbing every conceivable lock to try out your key. Instead, you’re finding people (the lock), and since you are curious about their dreams and desires, you will create a key just for them, one they’ll happily trade attention for. A lifeguard doesn’t have to spend much time pitching to the drowning person. When you show up with a life buoy, if the drowning person understands what’s at stake, you don’t have to run ads to get them to hold on to it.

## 🎨 **Applications to Posters / Graphic Design Business**

- Observe what kind of posters your audience interacts with—are they into humor, nostalgia, or pop culture?
