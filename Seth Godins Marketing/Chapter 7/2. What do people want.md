# 🧠 **Insight: What Do People Want?**

>_What do people want?_

>If you ask them, you probably won’t find what you’re looking for. You certainly won’t find a breakthrough. It’s our job to watch people, figure out what they dream of, and then create a transaction that can deliver that feeling. 
>The crowd didn’t invent the Model T, the smartphone, or rap. The crowd didn’t invent JetBlue, City Bakery, or charity: water either. Crowdfunding is one thing, but the crowd isn’t that good at inventing a breakthrough. 
>There are three common confusions that many of us get stuck on. The first is that people confuse wants and needs. What we need is air, water, health, and a roof over our heads. Pretty much everything else is a want. And if we’re privileged enough, we decide that those other things we want are actually needs. 
>The second is that people are intimately aware of their wants (which they think of as needs) but they are absolutely terrible at inventing new ways to address those wants. They often prefer to use a familiar solution to satisfy their wants, even if it’s not working very well. When it comes time to innovate, they get stuck. 
>The third is mistakenly believing that everyone wants the same thing. In fact, we don’t. The early adopters want things that are new; the laggards want things to never change. One part of the population wants chocolate, another vanilla.

## 📌 **Summary:**

People don’t always know what they want—and they definitely can’t invent it for you. It's not their job. It’s _your_ job to observe, imagine, and create something that delivers a **feeling** they crave—before they even know it exists. Wants get mistaken for needs, and people tend to fall back on familiar (even bad) solutions. Great marketers recognize this confusion—and act on it.

## 🔑 **Key Insights:**

1. People mistake **wants** for **needs**—but most things are wants disguised as necessities.
2. People are **bad at inventing new solutions** to their problems—they look for familiar answers.
3. Everyone doesn’t want the same thing—**one size never fits all**.
4. You won’t find breakthrough ideas by asking customers what they want.
5. Observing **dreams, behaviors, and frustrations** is more valuable than surveying opinions.

## 💼 **Applications to Any Business:**

- Don’t rely on customer polls for innovation—**observe, empathize, then create**.
- Recognize **emotional wants** behind rational decisions (e.g., “I want a reliable car” → “I want peace of mind”).
- Serve **different customer segments** differently—don’t market to everyone the same way.
- Lead customers toward the future, don’t just echo their past choices.

## 🎨 **Applications to Poster/Graphic Design Business:**

- **Design for desire**, not just aesthetics. What do your buyers _wish they felt_ in their space?
- Don’t just ask followers “What poster should I make next?”—_watch what they save, like, and engage with_.
- Release unexpected, bold designs that provoke emotion—**create the trend, don’t follow it**.
- Test posters that _feel like statements_ rather than art—people want to be seen, not just to decorate.

## 👕 **Applications to Shirts Apparel Business:**

- Customers won’t tell you “design a crop hoodie with a vintage comic print”—**they’ll feel it when they see it**.
- Don’t wait for “votes”—take risks and **launch collections that feel ahead of the curve**.
- Identify the emotional want:
    - “I want comfort” = _I want to feel safe._
    - “I want bold colors” = _I want to stand out._
- Use **lookbooks** and reels to show _how the shirt fits a dream_ (e.g., beach, rooftop party, protest march).

## 📖 **Story: The Marketer Who Didn’t Ask, Just Watched**

Nikhil ran design for a niche apparel brand. He kept running polls. "Do you want graphic tees or plain fits?" “Should we bring back this old print?”

The answers were always predictable. Sales? Meh.

Then, one evening, he walked past a metro station where a group of college kids were hanging out. He noticed something: one kid had a torn denim jacket painted with DIY doodles. No one was asking for it—but _everyone kept looking at it_.

So Nikhil went back and dropped a limited line of “one-off looking” street-art shirts. No preview. No poll. Just one line in the caption:

> “You didn’t ask for this. But we knew you wanted it.”

Sold out in 3 days.

**Moral?** Customers can’t invent what they’ll love. But they’ll recognize it the moment they see it.
