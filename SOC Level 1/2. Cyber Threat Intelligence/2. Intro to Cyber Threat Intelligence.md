# Intro to Cyber Threat Intelligence
## 🧠 Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)

### 🔍 What is CTI?

**Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)** is **evidence-based knowledge** about adversaries—such as their **indicators, tactics, motivations**, and **actionable advice**—that helps protect critical assets and support security decisions.

CTI empowers both **security teams** and **executive management** to make informed decisions by providing context around who is attacking, how, and why.

### 🧩 Data vs Information vs Intelligence

> These terms are often used interchangeably but mean different things in CTI:

#### 🗃️ Data
- **Raw, discrete indicators** (e.g., IP addresses, URLs, hashes)
- Example: `203.0.113.42`, `maliciousfile.exe`, `badactor[.]com`

#### 📊 Information
- **Correlated data** that provides insight or answers a question.
- Example: “How many times was `tryhackme.com` accessed last month?”

#### 🧠 Intelligence
- **Analyzed information** with **context**, identifying **patterns and intent**.
- Supports **decision-making and proactive defense**.

### 🎯 Goals of CTI

- Understand the **relationship** between adversaries and your **operational environment**
- Enable defense and **risk mitigation**
- Build a threat context by answering:
  - Who’s attacking us?
  - What are their motivations?
  - What are their capabilities?
  - What IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) should we monitor?

### 📚 Sources of Threat Intelligence

#### 🔐 Internal
- Vulnerability assessment results
- Incident response reports
- System logs & SIEM alerts
- Cyber awareness reports

#### 👥 Community
- Cybersecurity forums (e.g., Reddit, StackExchange)
- Dark web intel
- Info-sharing platforms (e.g., ISACs)

#### 🌐 External
- Commercial threat intel feeds (e.g., Recorded Future, Mandiant)
- Open-source intel (e.g., AlienVault OTX, AbuseIPDB)
- Government reports, publications, social media, OSINT

### 🧠 Threat Intelligence Classifications

#### 🧭 Strategic Intelligence
- **Audience**: Executives, CISOs
- **Focus**: High-level trends, business impact
- **Use**: Strategic planning, risk management

#### 🛠️ Technical Intelligence
- **Audience**: Security Engineers, Analysts
- **Focus**: IOCs, malware hashes, exploit kits
- **Use**: Defense strategies, detection signatures

#### ⚔️ Tactical Intelligence
- **Audience**: SOC, IR teams
- **Focus**: TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures)
- **Use**: Threat hunting, SIEM rule creation

#### 🕵️ Operational Intelligence
- **Audience**: Threat intel teams, blue teams
- **Focus**: Motives, intent, target specifics
- **Use**: Targeted response, incident context

### 📖 Story Mode: The Day the Network Went Dark

It was a sleepy Monday morning when the SOC team received alerts of abnormal outbound traffic to an IP in Eastern Europe. At first glance, it was just another random hit—but something about it didn’t feel right.

**Sarah**, a seasoned analyst, began digging. She spotted a strange `.exe` file downloaded three days ago from a compromised subdomain of a government site. This was her **data**.

She correlated this with firewall logs and saw similar downloads across multiple departments—**information** that revealed a pattern of compromise.

Using her **CTI dashboard**, she connected the dots to an APT group known for targeting healthcare industries with phishing and remote access trojans. This **intelligence** provided the *why* behind the attack: **financial gain through ransomware**.

CTI helped Sarah answer:
- **Who** was attacking (APT28)
- **Why** (ransom and access to sensitive medical records)
- **What** tools they were using (custom RAT, obfuscated phishing)
- **Where** to look for IOCs (registry changes, suspicious DNS queries)

She shared this with the CISO and mapped the adversary's tactics to **MITRE ATT&CK**, applying **tactical intel** to harden controls. Simultaneously, the incident response team used **technical intel** to isolate infected machines and scan for IOCs across the network.

**Strategic intelligence** helped leadership understand the broader risk landscape and justify budget increases for endpoint security.

By Thursday, the attack had been contained. Sarah reflected on the week, proud that **CTI turned scattered digital breadcrumbs into a cohesive defense story**—one that kept the company safe.

## 🔁 Threat Intelligence Lifecycle

Threat intelligence is **not a one-time activity**, but a **continuous cycle** of transforming raw data into **contextualised, actionable insights** to effectively triage and mitigate security incidents.

### ⚙️ The Six Phases of the CTI Lifecycle

#### 1️⃣ Direction
> Define the goals and scope of the CTI program.

Questions to answer:
- What information assets and business processes must we protect?
- What’s the **impact** of losing these assets or facing service interruptions?
- What **data sources** and **intel platforms** will be used?
- What **tools and team resources** do we need?

Outcome: A focused CTI strategy tailored to business risks and priorities.

#### 2️⃣ Collection
> Gather raw data from internal, external, and community-based sources.

- Sources: SIEMs, IDS/IPS, threat intel feeds, honeypots, open-source platforms, etc.
- Due to high volume, automation tools (e.g., SOAR platforms) are recommended.

Goal: Acquire the **right data** to support investigation and defense.

#### 3️⃣ Processing
> Normalize and organize raw data into usable information.

- Translate diverse formats (logs, PCAPs, emails, hashes) into a common structure.
- Apply tags, categories, metadata.
- Visualize in dashboards or reports.

Tools: SIEMs (e.g., Splunk, ELK), threat intel platforms, correlation engines.

#### 4️⃣ Analysis
> Transform information into intelligence by uncovering patterns and deriving insight.

Key tasks:
- Identify indicators, artifacts, and anomalies.
- Trace adversary TTPs using frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK.
- Recommend response actions, control improvements, or further investigations.

Outcome: Actionable intelligence with context and purpose.

#### 5️⃣ Dissemination
> Share tailored reports with relevant stakeholders.

- **C-Suite**: High-level reports with trends, risk impact, and business decisions.
- **Security Teams**: IOCs, TTPs, detection rules, response plans.
- **Other departments**: Awareness bulletins, policy changes, or training needs.

Key: Speak the right language for each audience.

#### 6️⃣ Feedback
> Collect input to improve the CTI cycle and security posture.

- What actions were taken from the intel provided?
- Was it useful, timely, and actionable?
- Are more tools or data sources needed?

Outcome: Adaptive CTI process that evolves with threat landscape.

### 📖 Story Mode: Life of an Analyst in the Loop

Meet **Ravi**, a threat intelligence analyst at a mid-sized fintech startup. One morning, the company’s firewall logs show outbound DNS requests to a suspicious domain: `paypa1l-login[.]cn`.

🚩 **Direction**: Ravi recalls the team’s focus this quarter—protecting customer data and login flows. He logs the event in the threat intel tracker as possibly related to **phishing-based credential theft**.

🧲 **Collection**: Using OSINT tools, a commercial feed, and a malware sandbox, Ravi pulls logs, WHOIS data, and related hash submissions.

⚙️ **Processing**: The data floods in—PCAPs, firewall logs, abuse reports. Ravi feeds this into their SIEM (Splunk), which sorts and tags it. It visualizes all devices that contacted the domain.

🔍 **Analysis**: Ravi finds similar attack patterns linked to **APT-C-27**, known for fake login pages and DNS exfiltration. The domain matches others used in their campaigns. He compiles a list of IOCs and notes that two endpoints are likely compromised.

📢 **Dissemination**: Ravi sends a short email to execs:  
> “We intercepted phishing activity linked to a known threat actor. No customer data loss yet, but two endpoints were compromised. Immediate isolation and MFA reset underway.”

Simultaneously, the security team receives:
> “IOC list: 4 domains, 2 IPs, 1 SHA256 hash. See Splunk dashboard for logs. Disable auto-login extensions company-wide.”

🔁 **Feedback**: Post-incident review confirms fast containment, but the CISO notes that real-time alerts must be improved. Ravi adds **DNS anomaly detection** to the collection phase for future cycles.

The loop continues—smarter, faster, better.
