>Early adopters are at the start of the marketer’s journey. But it’s important not to think of them as adapters. Adapters figure out how to get along when the world changes. They’re not happy about it, but they figure it out. The early adopters are different. They are neophiliacs—addicted to the new. They get a thrill from discovery, they enjoy the tension of “This might not work,” and they get pleasure from bragging about their discoveries. The work,” and they get pleasure from bragging about their discoveries. The neophiliacs are very forgiving of missteps from those who seek to innovate with them, and incredibly unforgiving after the initial thrill of discovery wears off. That relentless desire for better is precisely why they’re always looking for something new. You can’t be perfect in the eyes of an early adopter; the best you can do is be interesting. In your work as a marketer, you’ll be torn between two poles. Sometimes, you’ll be busy creating interesting new work for people who are easily bored. And sometimes, you’ll be trying to build products and services that last, that can extend beyond the tiny group of neophiliacs and reach and delight the rest of the market. There’s almost nothing a marketer can do that shouldn’t be prefaced with that distinction. The magic question is: Who’s it for? The people you seek to serve—what do they believe? What do they want?

## 📝 Summary  
Early adopters aren’t just people who *adjust* to change—they *seek it out*. They thrive on novelty, discovery, and the thrill of "what’s next." Unlike adapters, who grudgingly adjust to change, early adopters chase it and judge brands based on how interesting—not how polished—they are. Marketers must understand this distinction and tailor their work based on whether they’re targeting early adopters or aiming for mass adoption.
