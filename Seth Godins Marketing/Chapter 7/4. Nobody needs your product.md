# 🧠 Insight: Nobody Needs Your Product
## 📔 Book

> _Nobody needs your product_
> 
> It doesn’t make sense to say “people need a white leather wallet,” because: 
> 1. People don’t need a wallet. They might want one, but that’s different. 
> 2. People might decide that they want a white leather wallet, but they don’t want it because it’s white or because it’s leather; they want it because of how it will make them feel. That’s what they’re buying: a feeling, not a wallet. Identify that feeling before you spend time making a wallet.

## 📝 **Summary:**

No one _needs_ what you make. They want how it **makes them feel**. Your poster isn’t art. Your shirt isn’t fabric. They are tools to help your audience **become** who they want to be—cooler, more confident, more nostalgic, more loved.

> "We don’t sell stuff. We sell shifts in self-perception."

## 🔑 **Key Insights:**

- People don’t buy **products**; they buy **feelings**.
- A “need” is functional (wallet, shirt), but a “want” is emotional (confidence, identity).
- The real product is the **transformation** you promise:
    - An emotional shift from _“insecure” → “confident”_.
    - From _“invisible” → “seen.”_
- Identify the **emotional destination** before you design the physical thing.

    Example:
    > ❌ “Heisenberg vector art poster.”  
    > ✅ “Put this up when you need to remind yourself who’s in charge.”

## 📖 Brand Story: _The Shirt That Wasn’t a Shirt_

Rahul was frustrated. He had launched his first oversized shirt drop—a premium heavyweight fabric, embroidered artwork, subtle typography. The quality was 🔥. But sales? Meh.
His friend finally said, “Dude, I love your shirt, but what does it _mean_?
Rahul realized people weren’t buying **shirts**—they were buying **versions of themselves**.
So he shifted focus.
The next drop was called **“Soft Armor”**—not a shirt, but a **feeling** of protection and confidence. Every caption was emotional. The tagline read:
> “For the ones who want to feel untouchable… gently.”

Within a week, sales 5×ed. The product didn’t change. The **emotion did**.
