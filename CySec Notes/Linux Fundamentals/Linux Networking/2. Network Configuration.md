## 🌐 Network Configuration

- As a **penetration tester**, mastering Linux network configuration is essential.
- Helps in:
  - Setting up testing environments
  - Manipulating network traffic
  - Identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities
  - Optimizing testing procedures and results

### 🛠️ Key Tasks in Network Configuration

- **Managing network interfaces**
  - Assigning IP addresses
  - Configuring network devices (e.g., routers, switches)
  - Setting up network protocols

### 📡 Important Network Protocols to Know

- **TCP/IP** – Core protocol suite for internet communication
- **DNS** – Resolves domain names to IP addresses
- **DHCP** – Dynamically allocates IP addresses
- **FTP** – Used for file transfers

### 🧰 Additional Skills

- Understand both **wired and wireless interfaces**
- Troubleshoot **connectivity issues**

## 🔒 Network Access Control (NAC)

- A **key component** of network configuration that enhances network security.
- As penetration testers, understanding NAC helps us:
  - Identify access weaknesses
  - Test policy enforcement
  - Evaluate system hardening

### 🧱 Types of Access Control Models

- **Discretionary Access Control (DAC)**
  - Resource owners set permissions.
  - Flexible but less secure.

- **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)**
  - Permissions are enforced by the OS.
  - More secure, less flexible.
  
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
  - Permissions are tied to roles within an organization.
  - Easier to manage across multiple users.

### ⚙️ Linux NAC Configurations

- Use security policies:
  - **SELinux** – Security-enhanced Linux kernel policies.
  - **AppArmor** – Application-level access control.
  - **TCP Wrappers** – Restrict service access based on IP addresses.

### 🛠️ Monitoring & Analyzing Network Traffic

- **syslog / rsyslog** – System log daemons for capturing events.
- **ss** – Shows socket statistics.
- **lsof** – Lists open files and associated processes.
- **ELK Stack**:
  - **Elasticsearch** – Stores and indexes log data.
  - **Logstash** – Processes and parses log input.
  - **Kibana** – Visualizes data with dashboards.

### 🏢 Analogy

> Network configuration is like building a secure office:
- Wiring the rooms = configuring interfaces.
- DAC = some rooms open to everyone.
- MAC/RBAC = restricted rooms based on identity/role.
- Monitoring tools = surveillance systems.
- Troubleshooting tools (ping, nslookup, nmap) = on-site repair toolkit.

📌 _More on NAC tools and implementation coming up later in this section._

## 🌐 Configuring Network Interfaces (Ubuntu/Linux)

- As a penetration tester, knowing how to configure and inspect network interfaces is vital for:
  - Creating controlled lab environments
  - Adjusting settings for traffic monitoring/redirection
  - Troubleshooting connectivity issues

### 🛠️ Tools: `ifconfig` and `ip`

- **`ifconfig`**:
  - Traditional tool for viewing & configuring interfaces.
  - Still available but deprecated in newer distros.
- **`ip`**:
  - Modern, powerful replacement for `ifconfig`.
  - Offers extended features like routing, policy, and tunneling.

## 🔐 **Network Access Control (NAC) - Summary for Pentesters**

|**Access Control Model**|**Key Idea**|**Who Controls Access**|**Use Case Examples**|**Security Level**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**DAC (Discretionary Access Control)**|Owner controls access|The **user/owner** of the resource|File sharing on Unix, home networks, small organizations|Low to Medium|
|**MAC (Mandatory Access Control)**|System enforces strict rules based on labels|**System administrator** (no user override)|Military systems, government networks, classified environments|High|
|**RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**|Access based on **roles** not identities|**Admins** assign roles; permissions come from roles|Corporates, hospitals, financial systems|Medium to High|
### 🕵️‍♂️ As a Penetration Tester: What to Look For

#### 🟨 **Discretionary Access Control (DAC)**

- **Attack Surface**: If users have permission to grant access, look for **misconfigured file permissions**.
- **Tip**: Exploit shared folders or weak file permissions (`777`) on Linux/Unix systems.

#### 🟥 **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)**

- **Attack Surface**: **Harder to bypass**, but misconfigured labels can be a weakness.
- **Tip**: On systems like SELinux or AppArmor, check if the policies are permissive or poorly enforced.
    
#### 🟦 **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

- **Attack Surface**: Test for **role escalation**, i.e., whether a low-priv user can gain high-priv permissions.
- **Tip**: Focus on **misassigned roles**, **role chaining**, or logic flaws in **privilege escalation paths**.

### ✅ Quick Real-Life Examples

- **DAC**: Bob shares a file and gives read/write access to everyone. An attacker can modify/delete it.
- **MAC**: A file is marked “Top Secret” and Alice with only “Confidential” clearance can't even see it.
- **RBAC**: A “Manager” role can access salary records. If an intern is mistakenly assigned that role—boom.

## 🖥️ **Monitoring – Network Traffic Analysis for Pentesters**

### 🔍 What is Network Monitoring?

Network monitoring is the process of:
- **Capturing**,
- **Analyzing**, and
- **Interpreting** network traffic  
    to detect security threats, performance issues, or suspicious behavior.

### 🎯 **Primary Goals**

- **Identify vulnerabilities** (e.g., exposed protocols)
- **Detect threats** (e.g., port scans, brute-force attacks)
- **Capture credentials** (e.g., via FTP, Telnet, HTTP)
- **Understand traffic patterns** for anomaly detection
- **Aid in privilege escalation** and lateral movement
    
### 🧪 **Example in Pentesting**

> 🎯 You observe a user logging into an **FTP server over an unencrypted connection**.  
> You capture the **username and password** using a sniffer like Wireshark or Tcpdump.  
> ✅ These credentials may help you move deeper into the network.

---

### 🧰 **Common Network Monitoring Tools**

|**Tool**|**Platform**|**Use Case**|
|---|---|---|
|**Wireshark**|GUI (Windows/Linux)|Deep packet inspection, protocol analysis|
|**Tshark**|CLI version of Wireshark|Scripting and automation|
|**Tcpdump**|CLI (Linux)|Lightweight packet capture, filtering|
|**Netstat / ss**|Linux/Windows|Monitor current network connections|
|**Nmap**|Cross-platform|Network scanning and discovery|

---

### 💡 **Pentester Tips**

- Always **start with passive monitoring** before launching active scans.
- Focus on **unencrypted traffic**: FTP, Telnet, HTTP, SMBv1, etc.
- Use **filters in Wireshark/Tshark** (e.g., `ftp`, `http`, `tcp.port == 21`) to isolate key traffic.
- Look for:
    - Username/password pairs
    - Suspicious external IP connections
    - Command and control (C2) patterns
    - Large data transfers (data exfiltration)

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

Network troubleshooting is a crucial process that involves diagnosing and resolving network-related issues that can impact performance, reliability, and business operations—especially during penetration tests. Common issues include connectivity problems, slow speeds, and network errors.

To effectively troubleshoot these issues on Linux systems, a variety of tools can be used. Below are some of the most commonly used ones:

### 🔧 Common Linux Network Tools

#### 1. **Ping**

`ping` tests connectivity between two devices by sending ICMP packets and measuring response times.

```bash
tejaM20@htb[/htb]$ ping 8.8.8.8

PING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8) 56(84) bytes of data. 
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=119 time=1.61 ms 
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=2 ttl=119 time=1.06 ms 
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=119 time=1.61 ms 
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=2 ttl=119 time=1.06 ms 

... --- 8.8.8.8 ping statistics --- 
4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss

```

#### 2. **Traceroute**
`traceroute` traces the route packets take to a destination, showing each hop and its response time.

```
tejaM20@htb[/htb]$ traceroute www.inlanefreight.com

traceroute to www.inlanefreight.com (134.209.24.248), 30 hops max  
1  * * *  
2  10.80.71.5 (10.80.71.5)  2.7 ms  
3  * * *  
4  10.80.68.175 (10.80.68.175)  7.1 ms
```

- Asterisks `*` represent timeouts or blocked ICMP traffic.
- Useful for identifying where packet loss or delays occur in the route.

#### 3. **Netstat**

`netstat` shows active connections, listening ports, and protocol statistics.

```bash
tejaM20@htb[/htb]$ netstat -a


Proto Recv-Q Send-Q  Local Address      Foreign Address     State 
tcp   0      0       localhost:5901     0.0.0.0:*           LISTEN 
tcp   0      0       0.0.0.0:http       0.0.0.0:*           LISTEN 
tcp   0      0       0.0.0.0:ssh        0.0.0.0:*           LISTEN
```

- Helpful in checking which services are running and accessible.
- Great for spotting suspicious open ports or connections.

## ⚠️ Common Network Issues

|Issue|Common Causes|
|---|---|
|Network connectivity loss|Misconfigured firewall/router, cable issues, incorrect IP/DNS, hardware failure|
|DNS resolution failures|Incorrect DNS config, faulty DNS servers, typo in DNS entries|
|Packet loss|Congestion, faulty cables, interference, misconfigured MTU|
|Performance degradation|Outdated hardware, congestion, improper QoS configuration, unpatched systems|

## 🔐 Hardening Linux Systems

Security hardening protects Linux systems from threats, especially important during pentesting or in production. Here are three core tools:

### 1. **SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux)**

- **Type:** Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
- **Strength:** Fine-grained access control at kernel level.
- **Use Case:** Highly secure environments.
- **Pros:** Robust and comprehensive.
- **Cons:** Complex to configure and troubleshoot.
    
### 2. **AppArmor**

- **Type:** MAC, like SELinux, but profile-based.
- **Strength:** Easier to use and configure.
- **Use Case:** Systems needing solid protection with easier management.
- **Pros:** Simple syntax and profiles.
- **Cons:** Less granular than SELinux.
    
### 3. **TCP Wrappers**

- **Type:** Network-level access control.
- **Use Case:** Restrict access to services based on IP.
- **Pros:** Lightweight and easy to configure.
- **Cons:** Limited to network-layer controls, now deprecated in some distros.

## 🧪 Practical Tips

- Use a **personal VM** for experimentation.
- **Snapshot** before making changes.
- Try configuring SELinux/AppArmor/TCP wrappers manually to understand their behavior.
- Collaborate with others (e.g., in a Discord group) for real-world testing scenarios.

By mastering both network troubleshooting and Linux hardening, you'll strengthen your pentesting workflow and reinforce your overall system security knowledge. 🔐💻
