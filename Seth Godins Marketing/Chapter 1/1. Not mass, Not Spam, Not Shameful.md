# 🎨 Marketing Wisdom from Seth Godin — Applied to Poster Business

## 📔 Book
```book
Marketing has changed, but our understanding of what we’re supposed to do next hasn’t kept up. When in doubt, we selfishly shout. When in a corner, we play small ball, stealing from our competition instead of broadening the market. When pressed, we assume that everyone is just like us, but uninformed. Mostly, we remember growing up in a mass market world, where TV and the Top 40 hits defined us. As marketers, we seek to repeat the old-fashioned tricks that don’t work anymore.

## 📌 Summary

Seth Godin reminds us that marketing has changed, but most creators and businesses are stuck using outdated strategies. Instead of shouting louder or copying others, we should focus on connection, authenticity, and serving niche communities. For your poster business, that means being original, understanding your specific audience, and building a loyal community — not chasing mass-market attention.

## 🔑 Key Insights

- **Mass marketing is outdated**  
  Old-school tactics like TV-style promotion or broad targeting don’t work anymore.

- **Selfish marketing doesn’t connect**  
  Shouting to be heard makes your audience tune out.

- **We default to comfort zones**  
  Marketers still rely on tricks that no longer apply.

- **Assuming the audience thinks like us is risky**  
  Real connection comes from curiosity, not assumptions.

- **Real growth comes from creating value, not stealing attention**  
  Be original and expand the space — don’t just compete.
