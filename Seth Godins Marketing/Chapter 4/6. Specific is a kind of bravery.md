>Specific means accountable. It worked or it didn‚Äôt. It matched or it didn‚Äôt. It spread or it didn‚Äôt. Are you hiding behind everyone or anyone? You‚Äôll never be able to serve everyone, which is comforting, since you‚Äôre less likely to be disappointed when it doesn‚Äôt happen. But what if you committed to the smallest viable audience? What if you were specific about who you were seeking to serve and precisely what change you were trying to make? Organize your project, your life, and your organization around the minimum. What‚Äôs the smallest market you can survive on? Once you‚Äôve identified the scale, then find a corner of the market that can‚Äôt wait for your attention. Go to their extremes. Find a position on the map where you, and you alone, are the perfect answer. Overwhelm this group‚Äôs wants and dreams and desires with your care, your attention, and your focus. Make change happen. Change that‚Äôs so profound, people can‚Äôt help but talk about it. Lean entrepreneurship is built around the idea of the minimal viable product. Figure out the simplest useful version of your product, engage with the market, and then improve and repeat. What people miss about this idea is the word viable. No fair shipping junk. It doesn‚Äôt help to release something that doesn‚Äôt work yet. When we combine these ideas, we can think small and think quickly. Our agile approach to the market combined with a relentless focus on those we seek to serve means that we‚Äôre more likely to be of service. Entrepreneur and Silicon Valley pioneer Steve Blank introduced a focus on the customer as the only project of a startup. Customer development is the act of gaining traction with customers, of finding a fit between what you make and what they want. This traction is worth far more than fancy technology or expensive marketing. That, and only that, separates successful projects from unsuccessful ones. Are there people in the world who want you to succeed so badly that they‚Äôre willing to pay you to produce the change you seek to make? Everything gets easier when you walk away from the hubris of everyone. Your work is not for everyone. It‚Äôs only for those who signed up for the journey
