>Effective marketers don’t begin with a solution, with the thing that makes them more clever than everyone else. Instead, we begin with a group we seek to serve, a problem they seek to solve, and a change they seek to make. There’s a gap in the market where your version of better can make a welcome change happen. Not a tactical change. Not a quarter-inch hole, or even a quarterinch drill bit. No, we can change someone on an emotional level. Our calling is to make a difference. A chance to make things better for those we seek to serve. Yes, you have a calling: to serve people in a way that they need (or want). The opportunity is for each of us to choose a path and follow that, not for your own benefit, but because of what it can produce for others.

- Your **version of better** should fit into a gap in the market—emotionally and contextually.
- Marketing becomes a **calling**, not a hustle, when rooted in **service**.

## 🧩 Applications to Any Business
- Ask: “Who is this for?” and “What problem are they wrestling with emotionally?”
- Don't sell features. Sell a future—**what will your customer feel or become** after using your product or service?
- A business thrives when it aligns its offering with the *real*, *felt* needs of a specific group of people.

## 🎨 Applications to Your Poster / Design Brand
- Every poster you make should either **inspire**, **connect**, or **solve a mood problem** (boredom, stress, lack of motivation).
- Instead of saying “cool design,” say “this is for people who feel stuck and want a reminder that they’re powerful.”
- Create themes that address **identity, struggle, joy, nostalgia, rebellion, or dreams**—problems people feel but don’t always say.
- Design with the mindset: “What transformation will this poster help spark in someone’s day or room?”
