>Emotional labor is the work of doing what we don’t feel like doing. It’s about showing up with a smile when we’re wincing inside, or resisting the urge to chew someone out because you know that engaging with him will make a bigger difference. It takes a small amount of energy and guts to be authentic. You need to feel confident enough to let your true feelings be exposed, knowing that if you’re rejected, it’s personal. But there’s a lot of hiding involved as well—hiding from the important work of making change happen. If all you do is follow your (make-believe) muse, you may discover that the muse is a chicken, and it’s steering you away from the important work. And if the authentic you is a selfish jerk, please leave him at home. If you need to be authentic to do your best work, you’re not a professional, you’re a fortunate amateur. Fortunate, because you have a gig where being the person you feel like being in the moment actually helps you move forward. For the rest of us, there’s the opportunity to be a professional, to exert emotional labor in search of empathy—the empathy to imagine what someone else would want, what they might believe, what story would resonate with them. We don’t do this work because we feel like it in the moment. We do this work, this draining emotional labor, because we’re professionals, and because we want to make change happen. Emotional labor is the work we do to provide service.

## 📌 **Summary:**

While authenticity is often glorified, it’s emotional labor that creates real impact. Professionals **don’t wait to “feel like it”**—they show up, smile, and serve. Emotional labor is the effort we invest in **empathy, service, and change-making**, even when it’s uncomfortable or inconvenient. Unlike the amateur who relies on being in the right mood, a professional chooses consistency, compassion, and deliberate action.

## 🔑 **Key Insights:**

1. **Emotional Labor > Emotional Authenticity:**  
    The work of showing up and doing what matters, regardless of how you feel, is what drives real change.
2. **Authenticity Isn’t Always Helpful:**  
    If “being yourself” means being selfish or inconsistent, it’s a liability, not an asset.
3. **Professionals Show Up Even When It’s Hard:**  
    Professionals don’t wait for inspiration; they deliver value despite discomfort.
4. **Empathy Is a Skill, Not a Feeling:**  
    The goal is to understand what your audience needs, not to share your every mood.
5. **Service is the Objective:**  
    This emotional labor isn’t for the marketer—it’s for the audience, the client, the user.

## 📖 **Story: How a Marketer Applied Emotional Labor to the Apparel Business**

Swathi, who handled social for a premium shirt apparel brand, started out posting raw, real, and unfiltered updates—stories about sleep-deprived print nights, angry supplier rants, and “authentic” emotional breakdowns during deadlines.

The posts flopped.

Then she flipped the script. Instead of telling her story, she **told her customers’ story**. She imagined how they felt: confident in that bold shirt, inspired in that artful design, stylish at a party. Even when she had a bad day, she posted stories of **how the customer would feel wearing the product**.

When a delay happened, instead of saying “Ugh, printers messed up again 😩,” she said, “We’re fixing a snag so your next order hits harder—thanks for your patience!”

She wasn’t faking it—she was showing up to serve.

Sales grew. DMs got sweeter. And followers said: “It feels like this brand _gets me_.”

Swathi learned: **real marketing isn’t being real—it’s being ready to serve.**
