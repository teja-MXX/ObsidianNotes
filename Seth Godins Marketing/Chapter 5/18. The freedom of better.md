>After the refrigerator was popularized, there wasn’t a good reason to continue hiring the ice delivery man. It wasn’t better worth paying for. After the supermarket took off, it got harder to justify the work of the milkman. And now we can all take advantage of the huge shifts in what it takes to do what we used to do (it’s all at our fingertips now, right?) and use that leverage to redefine better. Because better is what our market is waiting for. Consider the real estate broker. He used to hoard data. If you didn’t hire a broker, you had no information about what you were looking for. Today, in a world where Zillow has 110 million homes listed, the home shopper is likely to have access to at least as much information as the broker does. If the goal is to defend the status quo, to be a chokepoint, it’s going to require an exhausting sprint, one that tries to keep ahead of an ever-quickening technology and information flow. But what would better look like? Not for you, but for the customer? This shift is true for many of us. So much of the work is networked, automated, and reliable now. I needed a team of eight engineers and a budget of millions of dollars to send emails to a million people in 1994. Today, anyone can do it for nine dollars a month using Feedblitz. A decade ago, it took a dedicated team of publishers, print brokers, and sales reps to get a book to be available nationwide. Now a Kindle book can be published by one smart person with a digital file. We made the “doing” easier, which is precisely why we need to outsource that part of our job and focus all our energy onto the hard work of making change happen.
