# 🛡️ MITRE
## 🛡️ Introduction to MITRE in Cybersecurity

### 🏛️ What is MITRE?

MITRE is a **U.S.-based non-profit organization** known for its work in:
- **Cybersecurity**
- **Artificial Intelligence**
- **Health Informatics**
- **Space Security**
- ...and more.

> 💬 **From MITRE.org**:  
> *"At MITRE, we solve problems for a safer world. Through our federally funded R&D centers and public-private partnerships, we work across government to tackle challenges to the safety, stability, and well-being of our nation."*


### 🧠 Known For: CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)
- MITRE is the **official maintainer** of the CVE database.
- CVEs are **public identifiers** for vulnerabilities.
- Commonly used by security researchers and penetration testers when identifying known vulnerabilities and exploits.

### 🔍 MITRE Cybersecurity Frameworks & Resources

1. **ATT&CK®** – *Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge*
2. **CAR** – *Cyber Analytics Repository*
3. **ENGAGE**
4. **D3FEND** – *Detection, Denial, and Disruption Framework Empowering Network Defense*
5. **AEP** – *ATT&CK Emulation Plans*

### 🎯 Why It Matters

- These MITRE tools help:
  - Understand real-world attacker behavior.
  - Build stronger threat detection and response capabilities.
  - Bridge the gap between offensive and defensive cyber knowledge.

### ✅ Next Steps
- Familiarize yourself with the **MITRE ATT&CK Matrix**.
- Explore **D3FEND** to strengthen your defensive posture.
- Use **CAR analytics** to create meaningful detections.
- Try **AEPs** to emulate threats in your lab environment.

## 🧠 Key Cybersecurity Terms: APT & TTPs

### 🎯 APT – Advanced Persistent Threat

- **Definition**:  
  An APT refers to a **team, threat group, or nation-state** that conducts **long-term, targeted attacks** on organizations or countries.

- **Important Notes**:
  - The term "advanced" doesn't always mean **highly sophisticated or zero-day exploits**.
  - Most APTs use **common, detectable techniques**.
  - They are often **persistent**, focusing on long-term objectives like espionage, data theft, or disruption.

- 🔗 **Resource**:  
  View **FireEye's APT group list** for real-world examples.

### ⚔️ TTP – Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures

This acronym breaks down **how attackers operate**:

#### 1. **Tactic** (What)
- The **goal** or **objective** of the adversary.
- Example: Gaining initial access, maintaining persistence.

#### 2. **Technique** (How)
- The **general method** used to achieve a tactic.
- Example: Phishing, exploiting public-facing apps.

#### 3. **Procedure** (How in detail)
- The **specific implementation** or variation of a technique.
- Example: Sending a phishing email with a fake Office 365 login page.


### 🛠️ Why These Terms Matter

- Used heavily in **MITRE ATT&CK**, threat intel reports, and red/blue team operations.
- Helps defenders:
  - **Understand attacker behavior**
  - **Detect and mitigate** real-world threats
  - Build **effective threat detection** rules

# 🛡️ Story: MITRE ATT&CK in Action – Operation QuietWater

At 10:04 AM, an alert landed in the SOC queue at NovaEdge Financial. A user’s machine had attempted to run PowerShell with a long obfuscated command. The EDR agent flagged it, but hadn’t blocked it.

Arjun, now a Tier 1 SOC Analyst, dug into the process tree. The PowerShell call had come from a macro-enabled Word document—emailed from a fake supplier. He created a ticket and began triage. 

He remembered something from his MITRE ATT&CK training. This technique—malicious document with macro that spawns PowerShell—matched **T1059.001: PowerShell under Execution**. He tagged it accordingly in the ticket.

As the investigation deepened, they realized the attacker wasn’t just dropping malware. The payload was connecting to an IP over port 443 using a tool called Covenant. This was **C2 behavior**, matching **T1071.001: Web Protocols**.

Each activity was cross-referenced with the **MITRE ATT&CK Matrix**. It helped the team map tactics like **Initial Access**, **Execution**, **Command and Control**, and **Persistence** in a structured way.

Later, Tier 2 analysts linked the indicators and TTPs to a known **APT group**—suspected to be a financially motivated actor tracked in public reports. Arjun read through the threat intel. The group had reused similar infrastructure against banking and fintech targets.

By analyzing the adversary’s **TTPs** (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures), the SOC team could predict what might happen next—likely credential dumping and lateral movement. They proactively started hunting for **T1003: OS Credential Dumping** and isolated two endpoints showing abnormal LSASS access.

Leadership was briefed using MITRE’s language. Instead of vague summaries, they had structured insights: “The adversary used T1566.001 to deliver the payload, T1059.001 to execute it, and T1071.001 to maintain control.”

The team even ran a **D3FEND** check afterward, identifying how to strengthen their defenses—by disabling Office macros, enforcing PowerShell logging, and implementing anomaly-based alerting.

As a final step, they built a mini **AEP**—an ATT&CK Emulation Plan—to simulate the exact attack flow in their test environment. This helped the blue team fine-tune their detection rules.

Arjun updated his Obsidian notes that night. This wasn’t just theory anymore. The MITRE framework wasn’t just a matrix—it had helped turn chaos into clarity.
