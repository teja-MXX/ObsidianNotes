## 📖 Story mode

In the heart of a bustling cyber defense agency, a team of elite analysts—let's call them _The Cyber Detectives_—faced a daunting challenge: tracking a rising tide of sophisticated cyberattacks targeting everything from banks to government networks.

They needed a place to **collect clues**, **connect patterns**, and **share their findings** with other trusted teams across the world. That’s when they discovered **MISP**, a magical vault designed for **sharing threat intelligence**.

### 🔍 Inside the Vault

Once inside MISP, the detectives noticed it wasn’t just a boring data dump. It was **intelligently structured**:

- **Events** were like folders holding everything about an incident—IP addresses, file hashes, suspicious domains.
- Each clue inside these folders was called an **Attribute**—small but powerful.
- Sometimes, they bundled related attributes into **Objects**—like grouping all evidence from a phishing email.
- They drew connections using **Object References**, showing how a fake login page was tied to a malware campaign.

They even had **Event Graphs**, like crime boards showing how everything was connected!

### 🔄 Sharing and Learning

But the real power of MISP? **Collaboration.**
The detectives didn’t work alone. They shared what they found with:

- Other **cyber defenders**
- **Researchers** decoding malware families
- **Law enforcement** tracking international cybercriminals
- Even **fraud analysts** sniffing out financial scams
    
Each piece of info—called an **Indicator**—could be used by tools like SIEMs or NIDS to defend systems in real time.

### 🧠 Intelligence with Meaning

To make sense of the chaos, they used:
- **Tags** to label clues quickly
- **Taxonomies** to organize everything in a common language
- **Galaxies** to bring context, like "this attack matches the Lazarus Group's style"
    
And they tracked **Sightings**, which told them when and where an indicator showed up, proving it was active and real.

### 🚨 Always Evolving

When a new attack happened, the team:
1. Created an **Event**
2. Added all known **Attributes**
3. Checked for **Automatic Correlations**
4. Shared it securely with trusted partners
5. Got **Feedback** from others to update their findings
    
Thanks to MISP, they weren’t just reacting—they were anticipating the next move.

### 🧩 Moral of the Story

MISP turned their threat data into **actionable intelligence**, linked together like puzzle pieces. It wasn’t just about storing information—it was about **knowing who the enemy is, how they attack, and how to stop them together**.

## 🔹 Event Management Overview

MISP events are containers for all information regarding a security incident or investigation.

### 1. **Event Creation**

- Start with **Add Event**.
- Add:
    - Description
    - Timestamp
    - Risk level
    - Distribution level:
        - Your organisation only
        - This community only
        - Connected communities
        - All communities
        
- Option to assign a **sharing group** (predefined orgs).
- Use templates (e.g., _Phishing Email_) to pre-fill fields.
    
### 2. **Adding Attributes & Attachments**

- **Add Attribute** to manually enter indicators (e.g., IPs, hashes, domains).
- Options:
    - **For IDS**: If enabled, this attribute is used in signature exports.
    - **Batch Import**: Paste multiple attributes (e.g., IPs) line-by-line.
        
- **Attachments**:
    - Add malware samples, reports, or dropped artefacts.
    - If malware, mark file appropriately (will be zipped and password protected).
        
### 3. **Publishing Events**

- After creation, an **admin reviews and publishes**.
- Publishing makes the event accessible based on the selected distribution setting.

# 🧾 MISP: Feeds, Taxonomies & Tagging

## 🔹 Feeds
Feeds are sources that provide updated threat intelligence (IOCs, events, attributes).

#### 📌 Feed Features:
- Exchange threat data across communities
- Preview events/attributes before importing
- Selectively import events into your MISP instance
- Automatically correlate attributes from feeds and events
- Admin controls which feeds are available to users
    
## 🔹 Taxonomies
Taxonomies are structured classification systems to organize and tag events and attributes.

### 📌 Use Cases:
- Classify data for external processing tools (e.g., VirusTotal)
- Maintain tagging consistency before publishing
- Help IDS systems interpret data properly
    
### 📌 Format:

Machine tags → **namespace:predicate="value"**  
Example: `tlp:level="red"`
Taxonomies are found under **Event Actions** and managed by the site admin.

## 🔹 Tagging
Tags are labels applied to events and attributes using taxonomy-based or custom values.

### 📌 Purposes:

- Identify data by threat type, risk, origin, etc.
- Enable precise and structured data sharing
- Enhance filter/search capability in MISP
    
### 📌 Tag Types:

- **Global Tags**: Available to everyone on the MISP instance
- **Local Tags**: Specific to your org or context
- **Custom Tags**: User-defined tags for internal use
    

Tags can be added:
- **At the event level** (recommended for overall context)
- **At the attribute level** (only for specific exceptions)
    
## 🔹 Tagging Best Practices

- **Event-level tags**: Apply broad classification (e.g., TLP:AMBER)
- **Attribute-level tags**: Only for deviations or fine-grained control
- **Minimal Essential Tags**:
    - **Traffic Light Protocol (TLP)**: Sharing restriction
    - **Confidence**: Data reliability
    - **Origin**: Source type (manual or automated)
    - **Permissible Actions Protocol (PAP)**: Usage guidance
        
## 📖 Story Summary: MISP Tagging & Feeds Made Simple

Meet **Ananya**, an incident responder for a large telecom company. She’s investigating a phishing attack that led to a **Cobalt Strike** implant.
She logs into **MISP**, but this time, instead of creating a new event, she needs intel to enrich her ongoing investigation.
She clicks on **Feeds**, enabled by her site admin. She sees updated indicators about similar Cobalt Strike infections across other regions.
“Great! These IPs and hashes could be relevant.” She selects a few feeds, previews the events, and imports them into her instance.

Next, she uses **Taxonomies** to tag her event:
- She chooses the **Phishing** and **APT29** tags under the **Threat Actor** taxonomy.
- She sets **TLP:AMBER** to indicate sharing with trusted partners only.
- She adds a **Confidence:high** tag, confirming the IOCs are validated.

She also uploads a suspicious payload hash from the user’s endpoint as an attribute—and here, she tags it differently: **Confidence:low** since it’s still being investigated.

Thanks to tagging:

- Her team can immediately search for relevant events.
- Other teams using MISP will instantly understand the context and trust level.
- Automated systems can integrate her data into SIEMs and NIDS effectively.
    
With feeds enriching her intel and taxonomy-driven tags adding structure, Ananya has built a rich, shareable event that benefits both her org and the wider community.
