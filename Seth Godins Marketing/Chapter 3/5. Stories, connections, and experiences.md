# Stories, connections, and experiences

## üìò Book

> The good news is that we don‚Äôt need to rely on the shiniest, latest digital media shortcut‚Äîwe have even more powerful, nuanced, and timeless tools at our disposal.  
> _**We tell stories.**_ Stories that resonate and hold up over time. Stories that are true, because we made them true with our actions and our products and our services.  
> _**We make connections.**_ Humans are lonely, and they want to be seen and known. People want to be part of something. It‚Äôs safer that way, and often more fun.  
> _**We create experiences.**_ Using a product, engaging with a service. Making a donation, going to a rally, calling customer service. Each of these actions is part of the story; each builds a little bit of our connection. As marketers, we can offer these experiences with intent, doing them on purpose.  
> The entire organization works for and with the marketer, because marketing is all of it. What we make, how we make it, who we make it for. It is the effects and the side effects, the pricing and the profit, all at once.
