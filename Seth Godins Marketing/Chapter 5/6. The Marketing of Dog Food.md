>Dog food must be getting better. More nutritious and of course, delicious. Americans spent more than twenty-four billion dollars on dog food last year. The average price has skyrocketed, and so has the gourmet nature of ingredients, like sweet potatoes, elk, and free-range bison. And yet, I’ve never seen a dog buy dog food. Have you? Dog food might be getting more delicious as it gets more expensive, but we Dog food might be getting more delicious as it gets more expensive, but we actually have no idea. We have no clue whether dogs enjoy it more, because we’re not dogs. But we can be sure that dog owners like it more. Because dog food is for dog owners. It’s for the way it makes them feel, the satisfaction of taking care of an animal that responds with loyalty and affection, the status of buying a luxury good, and the generosity of sharing it. Some dog owners want to spend more on the dog food they buy. Some want gluten-free dog food, loaded with high-value placebos. But let’s not get confused about who all this innovation is for. It’s not for the dogs. It’s for us. A marketer for a dog food company might decide that the secret of more dog food sales is to make a food that tastes better. But that requires understanding how a dog thinks, which is awfully difficult. It turns out that the right formula is to make a dog food that dog owners want to buy. The purpose of this example isn’t to help you market dog food better. It’s to understand that there’s almost always a disconnect between performance and appeal. That the engineer’s choice of the best price/performance combination is rarely the market’s choice. There are two voices in our heads. There’s the dog’s voice, the one that doesn’t have many words, but knows what it wants. And there’s the owner’s voice, which is nuanced, contradictory, and complex. It’s juggling countless inputs and is easily distracted. Like the dog owner who is choosing based on a hundred factors (but not taste), the people you seek to serve care about a range of inputs and emotions, not simply a contest for who’s the cheapest. Choose your extremes and you choose your market. And vice versa.

## 📝 Summary  
Dog food isn’t really marketed for dogs—it’s marketed for *dog owners*. The innovation, ingredients, and pricing all cater to how the *owners* feel, not how the dog feels. This illustrates a larger truth: products are often purchased for emotional reasons unrelated to raw performance or utility.

## 💡 Key Insights  
- Buyers are not always the users. In many cases, like dog food, the buyer's emotions are what drive the purchase.  
- Innovation often focuses on appeal, not performance.  
- Marketing should target the *decision-maker’s desires*, even when the product isn’t for them.  
- There’s a key disconnect between what works and what sells—marketers need to serve emotional logic, not just technical logic.  
- Consumers make choices based on complex emotions, not just utility.

## 🧠 Applications to Any Business  
- Always ask: “Who is this really for?” and market to that person’s emotions.  
- Don’t assume performance or quality alone will win—appeal matters more.  
- Understand your customer’s emotional motivations: pride, generosity, fear, status, nostalgia.  
- Your messaging must resonate with the buyer’s *identity* and values.  
- You don’t need to “improve the product” for the user—sometimes improving the *story* for the buyer is what sells.

## 🎨 Applications to My Posters/Graphic Design Business  
- Your posters aren’t just wall decor—they’re a statement buyers make about themselves.  
- Tap into the buyer’s emotions: humor, rebellion, nostalgia, fandom, uniqueness.  
- Don’t focus solely on the technical excellence of the art—highlight the feeling it gives.  
- Sell the story: “This poster isn’t for everyone. It’s for the one who gets the reference.”  
- Think of your customer as the *dog owner*—someone who wants to feel cool, smart, funny, or unique when they display your work.

## ✅ To-Do List for My Instagram Handle (@yourhandle)  
- [ ] Make a reel titled: “Posters aren’t just for walls. They’re for people who want to say something without saying a word.”  
- [ ] Post a carousel: “What you see vs. what you *feel* when you hang this on your wall.”  
- [ ] Use captions that speak to the buyer’s emotions, not just design features (e.g., “You don’t just love Breaking Bad. You live it.”)  
- [ ] Add a testimonial highlight: how people *feel* when they hang or gift your posters.  
- [ ] Update product descriptions to reflect the emotion or identity buyers attach to your posters.  
- [ ] Avoid overexplaining the art; instead, speak to the *vibe* and *attitude* it conveys.
