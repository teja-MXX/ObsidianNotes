# 🛡️ Backup and Restore in Ubuntu

Linux systems provide a range of powerful tools for backing up and restoring data, designed to be both efficient and secure. These tools help ensure that our data is protected from loss or corruption and is easily accessible when needed.

## 🔧 Backup Tools on Ubuntu

### 1. **Rsync**
- Open-source
- Fast and secure
- Transfers only changed portions of files
- Great for incremental/network backups

### 2. **Duplicity**
- Builds on Rsync
- Adds encryption for secure backups
- Supports FTP, S3, and remote storage

### 3. **Deja Dup**
- GUI-based backup tool
- Simple and user-friendly
- Uses Rsync behind the scenes
- Supports encryption like Duplicity

> 🔐 Think of your data as valuable treasures stored in a house.  
> Rsync = fast-moving transport  
> Duplicity = high-security encrypted vault  
> Deja Dup = easy-to-use vault for everyone

## 🔐 Security Tip: Encrypt Your Backups
Use:
- `GnuPG`
- `eCryptfs`
- `LUKS`

These tools add extra layers of encryption, keeping backups safe from unauthorized access.

## 📦 Installing Rsync

```bash
sudo apt install rsync -y
```


## 📁 Rsync - Backup Examples
🔄 Backup a local directory to a remote server:
```bash
rsync -av /path/to/mydirectory user@backup_server:/path/to/backup/directory
```

- -a: archive mode (preserves permissions, timestamps, etc.)
- -v: verbose

## 📦 Compressed Incremental Backup
```bash
rsync -avz --backup --backup-dir=/path/to/backup/folder --delete /path/to/mydirectory user@backup_server:/path/to/backup/directory

```

- `-z`: compression
- `--backup`: keep backups of replaced files
- `--backup-dir`: store old versions
- `--delete`: delete files on destination that are not present in source


## ♻️ Restore from Backup
```bash
rsync -av user@remote_host:/path/to/backup/directory /path/to/mydirectory
```

## 🔐 Encrypted Rsync with SSH
```bash
rsync -avz -e ssh /path/to/mydirectory user@backup_server:/path/to/backup/directory
```
>Encrypted with SSH — safe from eavesdropping and tampering during transfer.

## ⚙️ Auto-Synchronization with Cron
### Step 1: Generate SSH Keys
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
```
> Leave passphrase empty for automation

### Step 2: Copy Public Key to Remote Server
```bash
ssh-copy-id user@backup_server
```

### Step 3: Create Rsync Script
RSYNC_Backup.sh
```bash
#!/bin/bash
rsync -avz -e ssh /path/to/mydirectory user@backup_server:/path/to/backup/directory
```
Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x RSYNC_Backup.sh
```

### Step 4: Schedule with Cron

```bash
# Edit crontav
crontab -e

# Add this line to run every hour at the 0th minute:
0 * * * * /path/to/RSYNC_Backup.sh
```

## ✅ **Summary:**
- Use `rsync` for efficient and incremental backups.
- Add `duplicity` or `deja dup` for encrypted or GUI-based workflows.
- Automate using cron and secure with SSH keys.
