# 📉 Shameless Marketers Brought Shame to the Rest of Us

## 📔 Book
```book
A short-term, profit-maximizing hustler can easily adopt a shameless mind-set. Spamming, tricking, coercing. Is there any other profession that proudly does this? You won’t find civil engineers who call senior citizens in the middle of the night to sell them worthless collectible coins. You won’t hear of accountants who extract customers’ data without permission, or orchestra conductors who proudly post fake reviews online. This shameless pursuit of attention at the expense of the truth has driven many ethical and generous marketers to hide their best work, to feel shame about the prospect of being market-driven. That’s not okay. The other kind of marketing, the effective kind, is about understanding our customers’ worldview and desires so we can connect with them. It’s focused on being missed when you’re gone, on bringing more than people expect to those who trust us. It seeks volunteers, not victims. There’s a groundswell of people doing marketing because they know they can make things better. They’re prepared to engage with the market because they know they can contribute to our culture. People like you.

## 🧠 Summary
Traditional marketing took a hit from unethical players — spammers, hustlers, and manipulators — who used deceitful tactics just to grab attention. This created a stigma around marketing itself, causing even honest creators to shy away from promoting their work.

But effective marketing is *not* about coercion. It’s about empathy, trust, and contribution. It's about being missed when you're gone and delivering more than expected to people who choose to engage with you.

You don’t need to be loud, fake, or manipulative to succeed. You just need to be generous, authentic, and aligned with the people who care about what you do.
